BACKGROUND \n \n\n2.1. Evolution in Surgical Revascularization \n \nCoronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was introduced in 1967 and rapidly became the \naccepted standard treatment for subjects with obstructive coronary artery disease who were \ndeemed necessary for coronary revascularization.1\n\n \n\nThe Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) trial in the 1970\u2019s2 showed that obstructive left \nmain disease was best treated with CABG compared to medical treatment.   Mortality was \nreduced by CABG in these subjects and thus has been the standard of care for over 30 years. \n \n\nRecent advances in coronary surgery include improvements in pre-operative risk assessment and \nmanagement, anesthesia, the use of arterial grafts, and improvement in post-operative care.3, 4, 5,6\n\n \n \n\nThese have resulted in further improvements with reduced hospital morbidity and mortality. \nFurthermore, with the use of arterial grafts the occlusion rate of bypass graft has been reduced \nand improved quality of life. \n \n\nWith the introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES), long-term outcomes after percutaneous \ncoronary  intervention  (PCI)  have  markedly  improved  in  patients  with  complex  coronary \nanatomy, justifying randomized trials of PCI vs. CABG. This resulted in the recent 1800 \nrandomized patient Synergy between PCI with TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) trial, \nwhich showed that PCI with paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) in a cohort of subjects with three \nvessel disease and left main disease with few other exclusion criteria was inferior to CABG for the \ncomposite primary endpoint of death, MI, stroke or unplanned revascularization at 1 year. \nHowever, post-hoc and subgroup analysis from the 705 left main stem subjects according to the \nanatomic SYNTAX score demonstrated that those subjects with low and intermediate SYNTAX \nscores had comparable or improved results with PCI compared to CABG. 7 However, as an \nunderpowered subgroup analysis, this observation is considered hypothesis generating. \n \n\n \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 22 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\nMost large-scale comparative trials of surgery vs. PCI have found higher rates of stroke in those \nundergoing CABG. 8 , 9 , 10 In  the  SYNTAX  trial,  the  incidence  of  stroke  at  one  year  was \nsignificantly higher in the CABG cohort than with PCI (2.2% vs. 0.6%, respectively, \nP=0.003).11This has been perceived by many surgeons as possibly not representative of current \nsurgical results. The surgical community believes that the stroke incidence may be further \nreduced by selective screening of the cerebral circulation, a shorter waiting time from \nrandomization to CABG, more careful management of the ascending aorta, and improved \nadjunctive pharmacotherapy. \n \n \n\n2.2. Percutaneous Coronary Intervention \n \nPCI was introduced into clinical practice in 1977, almost 10 years later than CABG, and was \ninitially considered appropriate only for subjects with single-vessel disease. 12  However, as \nexperience and technology have advanced, the indication has been expanded to treat subjects \nwith multivessel and more complex disease. \n \n\nIn the last decade, several randomized controlled trials (ARTS I, MASS II, ERACI-II) examined \nthe relative benefits of PCI and CABG in subjects with single or multivessel coronary artery \ndisease.13, 14  The validity of these conclusions has been questioned because of (1) subsequent \nimprovements in both percutaneous and surgical techniques as well as (2) strict inclusion criteria \nlimiting relevance to subjects treated in the \u2018real world\u2019. \n \n\nRe-evaluation  may  be  especially  important  in  the  case  of  PCI  as  stenting  is  applied  to \nincreasingly complex subjects. Moreover, the durability of the benefit of stenting to 5 years has \nbeen challenged. 15 The most appropriate treatment for left main disease subjects remains a \nmatter of considerable debate, especially since the introduction of drug-eluting stents (with \nsirolimus or paclitaxel).16, 17, 18, 19, 20  More recently, the second generation everolimus-eluting \nstent,  XIENCE V,  has  shown  superiority  in  angiographic  outcomes  compared  to  the  first \ngeneration PES in the SPIRIT III trial. The clinical outcomes for the XIENCE V stent compared \nto the first generation PES were superior at both three years in the SPIRIT III trial and at one \nyear in the SPIRIT IV trial as shown in Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2, respectively. The COMPARE \nrandomized trial also showed marked improvements in both safety and efficacy with the \neverolimus-eluting stent compared to the paclitaxel DES in an 1800 patient randomized trial \nwhich randomized patients with unprotected left main stem disease.21 Thus, clinical outcomes \nmay be further improved with left main and multivessel stenting with the XIENCE V stent \ncompared to drug-eluting stents used in earlier randomized trials. \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 23 of 169 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 2.1 SPIRIT III Trial: Major Adverse Cardiac Events at 3 Years (n=1,002) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n* MACE = cardiac death, MI, or ischemia-driven TLR \n \nFigure 2.2 SPIRIT IV Trial: Target Lesion Failure at 1 Year (n=3,690) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n* Target lesion failure = cardiac death, target vessel MI, or ischemia-driven TLR\n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 24 of 169 \n\n \n\n  \n\n2.3. The SYNTAX Trial \u2013 Influence of Anatomic Complexity \n \nThe potential influence of anatomic complexity in the SYNTAX trial was evaluated by examining \nthe outcomes of TAXUS DES vs. CABG in different subgroups from this trial according to the \nSYNTAX score.7  Subjects within the highest SYNTAX tertile (score of 33 or greater) had \nsuperior overall clinical outcomes (including lower mortality) when treated with CABG. (Figure \n2.3 and Table 2-1).  Conversely, the approximately two-thirds of the left main subjects with a \nSYNTAX score of 32 or below had comparable or superior clinical overall outcomes \n(including lower mortality) achieved with PCI at 3years follow-up which may justify the use of \nPCI with DES in these subjects (Figure 2.4 and Table 2-2).  However, these subgroup analyses \nwere post hoc and underpowered, and as such must be considered hypothesis- generating.  It is \nalso possible that, based on the recent data on XIENCE V from the SPIRIT Trials, the new \nsecond-generation DES would have competed more favorably with CABG. \n \n\n \nFigure 2.3      SYNTAX Trial: Major Adverse Cardiac and Cerebrovascular Events at 3 \n\nYears in the Left Main Subgroup with the Highest SYNTAX Score Tertile \n(SYNTAX Scores \u226533) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCumulative KM Event Rate = 1.5 SE; log-rank P value; site-reported data; ITT population \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 25 of 169 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nTable 2-1        SYNTAX Trial:  Components of Major Adverse Cardiac and Cerebro \nvascular Events at 3 Years in the Left Main Subgroup with the Highest \nSYNTAX Score Tertile (SYNTAX Scores \u226533) \n\n \nOutcome \n\nCABG \n(N=149) \n\nTAXUS \n(N=135) \n\n \nP-value \n\nDeath 7.6% 13.4% 0.10 \nCVA 4.9% 1.6% 0.13 \nMI 6.1% 10.9% 0.18 \nDeath, CVA, or MI 15.7% 20.1% 0.34 \nRevascularization 9.2% 27.7% <0.001 \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.4       SYNTAX Trial:  Major Adverse Cardiac and Cerebrovascular Events \nat 3 Years for the Left Main Subgroup in Subjects with the Lowest and \nIntermediate SYNTAX Score Tertiles (SYNTAX Scores 0-32) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCumulative KM Event Rate = 1.5 SE; log-rank P value; site-reported data; ITT population \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 26 of 169 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nTable 2-2          SYNTAX Trial:  Components of Major Adverse Cardiac and Cerebro \nvascular Events at 3 Years for the Left Main Subgroup in Subjects with \nthe Lowest and Intermediate SYNTAX Score Tertiles (SYNTAX Scores \n0-32) \n\n \nOutcome \n\nCABG \n(N=196) \n\nTAXUS \n(N=221) \n\n \nP-value \n\nDeath 9.0% 3.7% 0.02 \nCVA 3.3% 0.9% 0.09 \nMI 2.6% 4.6% 0.33 \nDeath, CVA, or MI 13.2% 8.7% 0.12 \nRevascularization 13.7% 15.7% 0.61 \n\n \n\n2.4. Other Studies Comparing PCI and CABG for Unprotected Left \nMain Coronary Artery (ULMCA) Disease \n\n \nOther studies specifically examining PCI for ULMCA disease include: \n\u2022 The LEMANS randomized trial, while only studying 105 patients, demonstrated a benefit of \n\nPCI compared to CABG in the primary endpoint of LVEF after left main revascularization: a \nsignificant increase in LVEF at 12-month follow-up was noted only in the PCI group (mean \n3.3% vs. 0.5% with CABG, P=0.047).22   Moreover, the LeMANS trial reinforced the \nwell-known benefits of PCI compared to CABG in reducing peri-procedural and short-term \nmorbidity.  In this trial, major adverse events within 30 days (including death, myocardial \ninfarction, stroke, major bleeding, major arrhythmia, unstable angina, acute heart failure, \nunplanned surgery or revascularization, renal failure, infection, post-cardiotomy syndrome, \nand sternal refixation) occurred in 8% of PCI patients versus 28% of CABG patients \n(P=0.006).  Subjects undergoing PCI compared to CABG also had significantly shorter \nhospitalization (mean 6.8 days vs. 12.0 days; P=0.0007). \n\n\u2022 The LEMANS Registry and the large scale LEFT MAIN-COMPARE registry demonstrated \nthat stenting of ULMCA is feasible and offers good long-term outcome.   Implantation of \nDES for ULMCA decreased the risk of long-term Major Adverse Cardiac and \nCerebrovascular Events (MACCE), and particularly improved survival in subjects with distal \nULMCA disease.23,24\n\n \n\n\u2022 The ISAR-LEFT MAIN randomized trial demonstrated that implantation of either paclitaxel \neluting stent (PES) or sirolimus eluting stent (SES) in ULMCA lesions is safe and effective; \nboth of these drug-eluting stents provide comparable clinical and angiographic outcomes.25\n\n \n\n\u2022 Recent meta-analysis26 of multiple trials among selected subjects with first generation DES \nshowed that death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (major adverse cardiovascular or \ncerebrovascular events) were similar in the PCI and CABG subjects at 1 year (odds ratio \n[OR]: 0.84 [95% confidence interval: 0.57 to 1.22]).   Target vessel revascularization was \nsignificantly higher in the PCI group at 1 year (OR: 4.36 [95% CI: 2.60 to 7.32]), 2 years \n(OR: 4.20 [95% CI: 2.21 to 7.97]), and 3 years (OR: 3.30 [95% CI: 0.96 to 11.33]).  \nThere was no difference in mortality in PCI versus CABG subjects at 1 year (OR: 1.00 \n[95% CI: 0.70 to 1.41]), 2 years (OR: 1.27 [95% CI: 0.83 to 1.94]), and 3 years (OR: 1.11  \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 27 of 169 \n\n \n\n  \n\n[95% CI: 0.66 to 1.86]).  The meta-analysis concluded that most studies demonstrate no \nsignificant difference in mortality or the composite of mortality, MI, or stroke, for up \nto 3 years, between PCI and CABG for the treatment of ULMCA stenosis in selected \nsubjects. However, PCI subjects have a significantly higher risk of target vessel \nrevascularization.  In selected subjects with ULMCA stenosis (especially in those without \ncomplex concomitant coronary artery disease, as seen in the SYNTAX trial), PCI is \nemerging as an acceptable option. Reflecting these findings, PCI for stenting of non-\ncomplex ULMCA disease has recently been given a class IIb recommendation in the \nguidelines of the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association.27 \n\n2.5. Quality of Life and U.S. Health Economics Sub-Studies \n \nUntil very recently, most physicians viewed the field of medical economics as an academic \nexercise that was irrelevant to daily practice (see also Section 17, Appendix B). Typically, new \ntherapeutic strategies and medical technologies were adopted by practitioners prior to any \ndefinitive evaluation of their effectiveness.  Such is no longer the case.  As health expenditures \nhave continued to grow, it is no longer sufficient for a therapeutic strategy to simply demonstrate \nimproved efficacy in order to be accepted into the mainstream of medical practice.  Today, \nphysicians, payers, and policy-makers have become increasingly interested in understanding the \nvalue of therapies by evaluating their cost-effectiveness.  Such economic evaluations assume \nparticular importance when the disease under consideration is either highly prevalent or very \ncostly. \n \nSince the earliest days of health economic studies, there has been interest in understanding the \nrelative costs and benefits of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and bypass surgery \n(CABG).  These  studies  have  been  motivated  by  both  the  frequency  and  costs  of  these \nprocedures, which currently account for more than $20 billion in annual health care expenditures \nin the U.S. alone.28   In the early 1980\u2019s, Weinstein and Stason29 first used data from the VA \nCooperative Study and the European Coronary Surgery Study to develop projections of life- \nexpectancy and symptomatic status for subjects with coronary disease treated with CABG or \nmedical therapy.  They estimated that for subjects with multivessel CAD, the cost-effectiveness \nratio for CABG (compared with medical therapy) ranged from $15,000 - $70,000 per quality- \nadjusted year of life (QALY) gained (costs adjusted to 1997 dollars).  Lower ratios were \nassociated with treatment of subjects with more extensive disease and more severe anginal \nsymptoms.  More recently, Wong and colleagues30 used a Markov simulation model to predict \nlong-term medical care costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy for subjects with chronic stable \nangina treated with either medication or coronary revascularization.  In contrast to Weinstein, \nthey also considered balloon angioplasty (PTCA) as a potential form of revascularization. Since \ntheir model was developed in the late 1980s, they did not incorporate the results of any of the \nmore recent randomized trials of PTCA vs. either medical therapy 31 , 32 , 33  or CABG.19, 34 , 35 \nNonetheless, based on observational data regarding the symptomatic and survival benefits of  \nPTCA, they estimated that for subjects with one- or two-vessel disease and moderate to severe \nangina, PTCA was economically attractive with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $10,000 - $40,000 \nper quality-adjusted year of life gained (costs in 1997 dollars).   For subjects with mild or no \nsymptoms, however, PTCA did not appear particularly attractive, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of \n$140,000-$200,000/QALY. \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 28 of 169 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\nCurrently, the best long-term data regarding the cost-effectiveness of PCI vs. CABG are from the \nBypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation (BARI).  Within BARI, Hlatky and \ncolleagues performed a prospective cost-effectiveness substudy among 934 of the 1829 trial \nparticipants.36 Based on 12-year follow-up data, they estimated that the mean cumulative cost of \nCABG was $123,000 vs. $121,000 for PCI. 37 Despite these higher costs, however, after \naccounting for the greater overall life expectancy with CABG (8.48 vs. 8.42 years) the \nincremental cost-effectiveness ratio for CABG vs. PCI was highly favorable at $14,300 per year \nof life gained.  Given the substantial differences in subject populations (BARI specifically \nexcluded subjects with left main disease) and revascularization techniques (BARI pre-dated the \nuse of either stents or drug-eluting stents as well as contemporary use of high dose statins and \ndual antiplatelet therapy), however, these results provide only limited insight into the cost- \neffectiveness of PCI with DES vs. CABG for subjects with left main disease. \n \n\nTo date, the only available data regarding the cost-effectiveness of PCI for left main disease are \nderived from the 1-year follow-up of the SYNTAX trial (Cohen DJ, ACC Scientific Sessions \n2009).   For the overall population of subjects with either 3-vessel or left main disease, initial \nrevascularization costs were ~$6000/subject greater with CABG than with PCI.   Over the \nsubsequent 12 months, repeat revascularization was significantly more common with initial PCI \nsuch that follow-up costs were ~$2500/subject greater with PCI.   Thus, at 12 months, total \nmedical care costs remained greater with CABG, by approximately $3500/subject.   Because \nthere were no differences in overall survival yet short-term quality of life was better with PCI, \nquality adjusted life expectancy was also slightly greater with PCI at this early timepoint. \nConsequently, PCI with DES was an economically dominant strategy at this relatively early \ntimepoint. Results were even more favorable for the subgroup of subjects (n=701) with left main \ndisease.  Among this subset, 1-year costs were $6300/subject higher with CABG and quality- \nadjusted life expectancy also favored PCI (by 0.03 QALYs) rendering PCI a highly dominant \nstrategy at this relatively early timepoint.  Although these results suggest that PCI could be a \nhighly attractive strategy from both a clinical and economic perspective for subjects undergoing \nrevascularization for left main CAD, longer term follow-up and additional confirmatory data will \nbe required to determine the durability and reproducibility of these findings. \n \n\n2.6. Justification for a Contemporary Large-Scale Trial Comparing \nPCI and CABG for LMCA Disease \n\n \nThe SYNTAX trial is the largest contemporary trial of DES vs. CABG in patients with complex \ncoronary artery disease, and with a primary endpoint of death, MI, stroke or repeat \nrevascularization at one year, confirmed the superiority of CABG compared to PES.  As a result \nthe SYNTAX investigators concluded that \u201cCABG remains the standard of care for patients with  \nthree-vessel or left main coronary artery disease, since the use of CABG, as compared with PCI, \nresulted in lower rates of the combined end point of major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular  \nevents at one year.\u201d7   However, SYNTAX was not powered to examine the outcomes of patients \nonly with left main coronary artery disease (with or without other diseased coronary vessels).  \n \nIndeed, the results of SYNTAX, as well as the numerous other trials discussed above suggest \nequipoise between PCI with first generation DES and CABG for the composite of mortality, \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 29 of 169 \n\n \n\n  \n\nmyocardial infarction or stroke, albeit with higher rates of repeat revascularization for PCI. \n \n\nAlthough the importance of mortality, MI and stroke as essential endpoints is universally \naccepted, no single trial has been adequately powered to examine whether CABG has superior, \ncomparable, or non-inferior rates of the composite endpoint of mortality, MI, or stroke compared \nexpressed that the inclusion of unplanned revascularization into the primary SYNTAX endpoint \n(which was necessitated for sample size requirements) biased the trial against PCI, as many other \nendpoints of equal or more important impact to patient well-being might have been selected \ninstead.  As discussed above, most trials (including SYNTAX) have shown that stroke rates are \nhigher after CABG than PCI, an endpoint significantly more important to physicians and subjects \nthan repeat revascularization.  Peri-procedural bleeding is significantly more common after \nCABG compared to PCI, and is a powerful independent predictor of early and late mortality in \nthis setting.38, 39, 40Subjects undergoing CABG compared to PCI have prolonged hospital stays \n(for example, mean 3.4 days after PCI vs. 9.5 days after CABG, P<0.001),7  greater  and prolonged \nincisional chest pain, and delayed return to work and activities of daily life. The impact of all \nof these adverse events, including the benefits from the greater prevention of recurrent ischemia \nand repeat revascularization with CABG compared to PCI, may be captured in quality of life \nmeasures. As reported from the One-Year Quality of Life SYNTAX Substudy,41\n\n \n\n \nPCI as compared to CABG had superior measures of quality of life in most measures at one \nmonth, though these outcomes had equalized by 6 and 12 months (Figure 2.5). \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 30 of 169 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5        SYNTAX Trial: Quality of Life Measures Comparing PCI and CABG \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 31 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\nMoreover, as described above, the SYNTAX trial had few exclusion criteria, and post hoc \nanalyses using the SYNTAX score have demonstrated a clear advantage of CABG for those \nsubjects with the highest risk SYNTAX tertile (score \u226533). In contrast, for subjects randomized \nto PES vs. CABG with a SYNTAX score of \u226432 (approximately two thirds of the left main \ncohort), mortality was lower with PCI at 3 years, and a trend was present for reduced composite \ndeath, MI or stroke with PCI, with nonsignificantly different rates of unplanned revascularization \nbetween PCI and CABG.   However, as a post hoc, subgroup analysis, these findings must be \nconsidered hypothesis-generating, warranting testing in an appropriately powered randomized \ntrial.  Furthermore, the primary endpoint of SYNTAX was measured at one year, a period which \nmay be too early to capture the intermediate term outcomes between PCI and CABG. \n \n\nIn addition, as described below, the XIENCE V stent has been shown to be superior to the PES, \nwith lower rates of stent thrombosis, MI and target lesion revascularization demonstrated in four \nrandomized trials (SPIRIT II, SPIRIT III, SPIRIT IV and COMPARE).  Use of XIENCE V may \ntherefore further improve outcomes in the PCI arm.  Since the SYNTAX trial was conducted, \nimprovements in PCI technique and adjunct pharmacotherapy have occurred (e.g. strategies to \nmanage the bifurcation, use of intravascular ultrasound and fractional flow reserve, bivalirudin \nand optimal thienopyridine use), as well as improvements in CABG (optimal use of arterial \nconduits, screening for and management of peri-procedural stroke risk, e.g., with epi-aortic \nultrasound, and optimal use of pre-, intra-, and post-procedural pharmacotherapy). \n \n\nThus, an appropriate trial to evaluate PCI vs. CABG in subjects with disease of the left main \nstem is justified, and would: \n \n\n\u2022 be restricted to those patients in whom clinical equipoise is present between PCI and CABG \n(SYNTAX score \u226432); \n\n \n\n\u2022 utilize optimal interventional and surgical techniques (allowing for acceptable variation \nbetween centers); \n\n \n\n\u2022 be adequately powered for a primary endpoint of mortality, MI or stroke, and at a later \nendpoint than one year (e.g. at 3 years); and \n\n\u2022 evaluate other important secondary endpoints including not only revascularization, but also \nin-hospital, short-term and as well as late outcomes, and quality of life and cost-effectiveness at \ndifferent intervals so a complete assessment of the risks vs. the benefits of PCI compared to \nCABG may be appreciated. \n\n \n\n2.7.

In SPIRIT III, treatment with XIENCE V stent compared with TAXUS stent resulted in a \n28.5% reduction in target vessel failure (14.3% vs. 20.0%) and a 40.9% reduction in MACE \n(9.7% vs. 16.4%) at 3 years.47   However, neither SPIRIT II nor SPIRIT III were powered for \nstatistical superiority testing in clinical end points, nor were they adequately sized to elicit \npotential differences in low frequency safety events between the two stent platforms.  Of note, \nroutine angiographic follow-up was prespecified in all subjects at 6 months in SPIRIT II and in \n564 subjects at 8 months in SPIRIT III, a protocol-specific process which may artificially \nenhance the absolute difference in TLR between the two stents by provoking angiographically \ninduced revascularization procedures, the so-called \u201coculostenotic reflex\u201d. 48 , 49 Although this \nprocess may not affect the relative difference in clinical efficacy between two stents,47, 50 routine \nangiographic follow-up should ideally not be performed prior to the primary clinical end point if \nan accurate and realistic assessment of treatment related differences is to be obtained.51  \n \nThus, the SPIRIT IV trial was performed with clinical endpoints only and represents an \nadequately-powered, single- blind, multicenter prospective trial comparing the XIENCE V stent to \nthe TAXUS EXPRESS stent in 3690 subjects (2:1 ratio of XIENCE V to TAXUS EXPRESS). The \nprimary endpoint was target lesion failure (TLF) defined as the composite of cardiac death, target \nvessel MI and ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR), and was superior for \nXIENCE V stent compared to TAXUS EXPRESS stent (TLF 3.9% vs. 6.6%, respectively, \nP=0.0008).50  In addition, both TLR (2.5% vs. 4.6%, P=0.001), MI (1.9%. vs. 3.0%, P=0.02), and \nARC definite or probable stent thrombosis (ST) (0.29% vs. 1.06%, P=0.003) favored the XIENCE \nV stent group.  These results were duplicated in the investigator-sponsored COMPARE trial (also \nperformed without routine angiographic follow-up), in which 1800 subjects were randomized to \nthe XIENCE V stent vs. the TAXUS Libert\u00e9 stent.21 Compared to TAXUS at one year, XIENCE \nV stent resulted in statistically lower rates of the primary composite endpoint of death, MI or TVR \n(6.2% vs. 9.1%, P=0.02), as well as MI (2.8% vs. 5.4%, P=0.007), ARC definite or probable ST \n(0.7% vs. 2.6%, P=0.002), TLR (1.7% vs. 4.8%, P=0.0002). \n\n2.7.2. XIENCE V Stent in Unprotected Left Main Coronary Artery \n(ULMCA) Disease Background \n\n \nThe French multicenter prospective observational LeMAX study assessed 1-year outcomes in \n174 subjects treated with the XIENCE V stent who had ULMCA disease and were treated with \nprotocol mandated provisional T-stenting.  The subjects represented a high-risk cohort with a \nmean EuroSCORE of 4.67, mean SYNTAX score of 25.1, and the presence of multi-vessel \ndisease in 46% of subjects. 76.2% of subjects had a SYNTAX score 0-32 and left ventricular \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 33 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\nfunction was well preserved.  Importantly, despite 81% of lesions involving the distal left main \nstenosis (74% bifurcation, 7% trifurcation), a mean of only 1.2 stents were implanted, and final \nkissing balloon inflation was used in 95% of lesions. The rate of MACCE, death, MI, stroke and \ntarget lesion revascularization was 14.7%, 4.1%, 2.5%, 1.6% and 2.5% respectively. The rate of \nMACCE-free survival at 1-year stratified according to SYNTAX score tertiles <22, 23-32 and \n\u226533 was 90%, 88.4% and 72.4%.  MACCE is defined as the composite of all-cause death, MI, \nTLR and cerebrovascular events.52\n\n \n \n\n2.7.3. XIENCE V Stenting in Multiple and Complex Lesions \n \nThere is evidence that event rates with the XIENCE V stent are lower than with TAXUS stent in \nsubjects with multiple vessels treated.  Data from the SPIRIT III trial suggest numerically lower \nrates for XIENCE V stent in dual vessel treatment compared to TAXUS stent53.  In the \nSPIRIT IV trial, subgroup analysis demonstrated that the relative benefits of XIENCE V stent \ncompared to TAXUS stent in reducing Target Lesion Failure rates (TLF: cardiac death, target \nvessel myocardial infarction, or target lesion revascularization) were consistent in most subgroups \nexamined, although the absolute differences were greater in complex subjects, such as those with \nlong lesions, small reference vessel diameter, and multiple lesions54. \n \n\nIn a recent pooled analysis of the SPIRIT II (n=300), SPIRIT III (n=1002) and SPIRIT IV \n(n=3687) trials in which XIENCE V stent was compared to TAXUS stent (randomized 3:1 or \n2:1) in 4689 subjects, clinical outcomes atone year were analyzed in subjects with either a single \nvessel treated (n=4152), or two or more treated vessels (n=1648)55. \n \u2022 Single treated vessel: Adverse outcomes trended lower in XIENCE V stent vs. TAXUS \n\nstent subjects with a single treated vessel for major adverse cardiac events (MACE: cardiac \ndeath, MI or TLR) (4.1% vs. 6.5%) and TLF (4.0% vs. 6.3%).  Stent thrombosis rates were \ncomparable between the XIENCE V single vessel treated subgroup and the TAXUS subgroup \nfor both protocol and ARC-defined \n\n\u2022 Multiple treated vessels: The observed TLF and MACE rates trended toward lower rates in \nthe XIENCE V subgroup compared to the TAXUS subgroup. The one year observed rates for \nTLF were 6.1% for the XIENCE V subgroup and 13.0% for the TAXUS subgroup. The \nobserved rates at one year for MACE were 6.3% for the XIENCE V subgroup and 13.4% for \nthe TAXUS subgroup. The observed difference in overall stent thrombosis rates at one year \nwas 1.3% (protocol defined) and 1.5% (ARC defined) between the XIENCE V subgroup and \nthe TAXUS subgroup, in favor of the XIENCE V subgroup. \n\n\u2022 In summary, for the one-year results of the SPIRIT II, III, and IV pooled analysis, the \nXIENCE V arm consistently showed numerically lower event rates for composite clinical \nendpoints than the TAXUS arm. \n\n \n\nFinally, in the SPIRIT V single-arm study of 2700 real-world subjects receiving an XIENCE V \nstent, the composite rate of cardiac death, target vessel MI and TLR (i.e. TLF) was predictably \nhigher in subjects with multiple vessels treated, compared to single vessel treatment, driven by a \nnumerically higher TLR rate with multiple vessels treated; yet, the absolute TLF rate of 7.79% \nwas low in this complex subject population, confirming the efficacy and safety of the XIENCE V \nstent in these subjects56. \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 34 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n2.7.4. XIENCE V Stenting in Medically Treated Diabetics \n\n \nIn both the SPIRIT III44 and SPIRIT IV50 trials, a significant interaction was observed between \nstent type and diabetes mellitus.  In this regard, with a pre-specified stratified randomization of \n1,185 diabetic subjects in SPIRIT IV (a larger cohort than the entire SPIRIT III trial), SPIRIT IV \nrepresents the largest comparative experience to date evaluating the outcomes of different DES in \nsubjects with diabetes mellitus.  The relative reduction in TLF with XIENCE V stent compared to \nTAXUS stent in subjects with diabetes mellitus was 6% (0.5% absolute reduction), compared to \n53% (3.6% absolute reduction) in subjects without diabetes mellitus.   While the point estimate \nfor the primary endpoint favored XIENCE V stent compared to TAXUS stent in both diabetic and \nnon-diabetic subjects, the differences in relative effect size suggests that the mechanisms of \nrestenosis and/or response to antiproliferative agents may vary in subjects with insulin resistance \nor deficiency 57.  Longer-term follow-up is required to determine whether differences between \nXIENCE V stent and TAXUS stent in subjects with diabetes mellitus emerge over time. \n \n\nIn the COMPARE trial, in a stratified analysis of the primary endpoint (all death, non-fatal MI and \nTVR) that was not pre-specified in the protocol, there was no difference between the everolimus-\neluting and the PES among subjects with diabetes mellitus (RR 1.00 [95% CI, 0.53-1.89], \nP=0.99) but confidence intervals were wide, and the results of a test of interaction were not \nsignificant.58  Thus, as in the SPIRIT IV trial, in the COMPARE trial as well, the XIENCE V stent \nand TAXUS stent appear to have similar clinical outcomes in the population of subjects with \ndiabetes mellitus. In the SPIRIT V single-arm study of 2700 real-world subjects receiving a \nXIENCE V stent, composite rates of all death, MI and TVR were predictably higher in subjects \nwith diabetes mellitus as compared to subjects without diabetes mellitus at one year, but composite \nrates of cardiac death, target vessel MI and TLR (i.e., TLF) were no different (5.73% vs. 4.80, \nP=0.3285).56   Overall, SPIRIT V confirms low event rates with everolimus-eluting coronary stent \nin real world subjects with diabetes mellitus. \n \n\n2.7.5.

STUDY DESIGN \n \n\n4.1. Study Design \n \nA total of approximately 2900 subjects will be targeted in the study. \n\n \nThe prospective, unblinded, randomized multicenter trial will randomize about 1900 subjects at \napproximately 165 U.S. and international centers.  Following diagnostic angiography \ndemonstrating significant ULMCA disease and the consensus of the local Heart Team (qualified \nparticipating interventional cardiologist and cardiac surgeon) that the subject meets all the study \nentry criteria, subjects will be consented and randomized 1:1 to: a) PCI using the XIENCE stent, or \nb) CABG.  Follow-up for all randomized subjects will continue for 5 years with a potential for \nadditional follow-up to 10 years. \n \n\nAn additional group of approximately 1000 subjects who are not eligible for randomization or \nfor other reasons are not randomized will be consented for the Universal Registry.  All patients \nwith left main disease without prior CABG in whom the visual estimated diameter stenosis is \ngreater than or equal to 50% will be eligible for the EXCEL registry.

No adverse event data will be \ncollected for Universal Registry subjects. \n \n\nApproximately 100 consecutive subjects from the Universal Registry with a \u226550% and <70% \nvisually estimated angiographic diameter stenosis who otherwise meet all enrolment criteria, but \nwithout significant ischemia by noninvasive testing consistent with significant ULMCA disease, \nand in whom IVUS shows a MLA >6.0 mm2 and/or a FFR >0.80 will be analyzed separately as \nintermediate lesion subjects, and followed through the time of initial treatment as per standard of \ncare with either PCI, CABG or medical therapy. \n \n\n4.2. Subject Follow-up \n \nAll randomized subjects will be followed for at least a five-year period post-procedure.  All \nrandomized subjects will have a follow-up telephone contact or office visit (preferred) at 30 days, \nat 6 months, and then at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years post procedure.  To support the 3 year endpoint \nanalysis, clinical sites will be asked to obtain the 3 year adverse event status on all subjects.  \nTherefore, at the time the last subject reaches the minimal follow-up duration, an additional \nadverse event (AE) check will be performed in order for data up to 3 years (365 days*3=1095 \ndays) from date of randomization to be established equally in both arms (see Section 8.2 for further \ndetails).   \n \nThe randomized subject consent form will also contain the potential for possible follow-up for a \ntotal of 10 years, with data collected from subject telephone contact or office visits at 6, 7, 8, 9 \nand 10 years.  Follow-up after 5 years and for up to 10 years will be performed at the sole \ndiscretion of the Sponsor, if funding is available.  Prior to the 5 year follow-up visit date for the \nfirst randomized subject, all sites will be notified if follow-up will continue for 5 or 10 years. \n \n\n4.3. Treatment Strategy \n \nThe treatment strategy for all subjects randomized in the trial is as follows: \n\u2022 All subjects participating in the randomized portion of clinical trial will have informed \n\nconsent obtained after diagnostic angiography and prior to randomization.  \u201cAd hoc\u201d ULMCA \nPCI is not permitted (with one exception \u2013 see Section 20.1.3.). \n\n\u2022 It is strongly recommended that the timing from randomization to treatment (PCI or CABG) \nbe \u22641 week, but it is mandatory that revascularization be performed \u22642 weeks after \nrandomization in all cases in both treatment arms.  Reasons for delay beyond 2 weeks will be \ntracked. \n\n\u2022 Target lesion(s) will be treated in accordance with the randomization schedule after satisfying \nthe general and angiographic inclusion and exclusion criteria as defined in the protocol.  If \nmore than one target lesion will be treated, all lesions must receive the treatment that has \nbeen assigned as per the randomization. \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 40 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n5.     ENDPOINTS \n \n\n5.1. Primary Endpoint and Key Secondary Endpoints \n \nPrimary Endpoint. The primary endpoint of the randomized trial is the composite measure of all- \ncause mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) \u22651 and increase \nby \u22651 from baseline) at 3 years post randomization.

The composite of all-cause mortality, MI and stroke (mRS\u22651 and increase by \u22651 from \nbaseline) at 30 days post randomization. This powered endpoint will be estimated via Kaplan-\nMeier failure rate defined from randomization and Greenwood\u2019s formula for estimating the \nstandard error. \n \n\n2. The composite measure of all-cause mortality, MI, stroke (mRS\u22651 and increase by \u22651 from \nbaseline), or unplanned revascularization for ischemia at 3 years post randomization. This powered \nendpoint will be estimated via Kaplan-Meier failure rate defined from randomization and \nGreenwood\u2019s formula for estimating the standard error. The analysis will be conducted at the time \nwhen approximately 50% of the patients have reached the 3-year follow-up AND all patients \nhave reached the 2-year follow-up, whichever time point is latest.

SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS \n \n\n6.1. Subject Population \n \nSubjects randomized into this trial will be comprised of male and female subjects from the \ngeneral interventional cardiology population. The randomized trial will randomize \napproximately 1900 subjects who meet all eligibility criteria and provide written informed \nconsent.  Each site should randomize a minimum of one subject, and may not randomize more \nthan a maximum of 250 subjects. \n \n\n6.2. Subject Screening \n \nOnce local IRB or ethics committee approval is obtained, potential subjects will be identified by \nqualified investigators in this trial and screened for study eligibility by the local Heart Team. \nSubjects eligible for randomization per the general inclusion and exclusion criteria will be asked to \nsign an informed consent for the randomized trial.  Subjects who do not satisfy inclusion and \nexclusion criteria or who are otherwise not randomized will be documented on the Heart Team \nWorksheet, and asked to sign a consent form for data collection for the Universal Registry. \n \n\n6.3. Stroke Assessment \n \nAll patients to be randomized into the Excel RCT will have a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) \nassessment conducted by mRS trained personnel at baseline and each visit and telephone \ninterview. Additionally, the site research coordinator will evaluate each subject at 30 days, 6 \nmonths 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 Y follow-up time points and at the primary endpoint follow up time point \n(either at annual follow up or at subject contact for primary endpoint AE check) using a Transient \nIschemic Attack (TIA)/Stroke Questionnaire (Appendix J) and mRS disability questions.

If a new stroke is \ndiagnosed at the site, the investigators at the site will prepare a short narrative that describes the \nfindings that support the diagnosis.  All stroke events will be adjudicated by the Clinical Events \nCommittee (CEC). Furthermore, if there is an increase in the mRS by one or more points noted \nat any visit, then an evaluation will be carried out to determine if a stroke or other outcome event \nhas occurred. \n \n\nPost-procedure, if a patient is diagnosed and adjudicated with a stroke event by the Clinical \nEvents Committee (CEC), a disability assessment must be performed at 90 days \u00b12 weeks after \nthe diagnosis of stroke using the mRS assessment instrument. \n\n6.4. Informed Consent \n \nTrial-specific subject procedures will not be started until a signed informed consent has been \nobtained.  The Investigator and/or a person designated by the Investigator who has been trained \non the protocol, will explain the nature and scope of the trial, potential risks and benefits of \nparticipation, and answer questions for the subjects.  If the subject agrees to participate, the \ninformed consent form must be signed and personally dated by the subject or legally authorized \nrepresentative.  The Investigator or a person designated by the Investigator must also sign the \ninformed consent form, prior to subject participation in this trial.  Any additional persons \nrequired by the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC) to sign the \ninformed consent form will also do so as required by the IRB/EC.  No subjects belonging to a \nvulnerable population will participate in the trial.  A copy of the executed informed consent form \nwill be provided to the subject.  In addition, the signed informed consent must be kept in the \nsubject\u2019s medical records.  A statement from the IRB/EC as to the requirements of additional \nsignatures is to be provided to the Sponsor. \n \n\nAll subjects must provide informed consent in accordance with the local IRB/EC, using an \nIRB/EC-approved informed consent form.  The final eligibility for the trial will be confirmed \nbased on the pre-intervention angiography. \n \nFor trials with investigational product: \n \n\nFor live cases at congresses, the subject needs to sign a specific Live Case ICF, approved by the \nIRB/EC and by AV, as well as by the competent authorities (e.g., FDA), as applicable. The \ninvestigator must request AV approval prior to performing a Live Case. \n \n\nFor trials with commercial product: \n \n\nFor live cases at congresses, the subject needs to sign a specific Live Case ICF approved by the \nIRB/EC.

For \nsubjects already receiving chronic aspirin therapy, the loading dose of 300 to 325 mg of aspirin \nmust still be given.

ADP antagonist pre-loading therapy is mandatory. In patients undergoing PCI, \nthe ADP antagonist must be given prior to the start of the interventional procedure according to \nthe timing for the selected agent below. For subjects already receiving chronic ADP antagonist \ntherapy, pre-loading is still mandatory. The choice of either clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor is \n\nleft to the discretion of the investigator. The one exception where ADP antagonist loading may \nbe first given after the procedure is in the case of the patient who qualifies for randomization \nexcept for the presence of a visually estimated 50% - <70% diameter stenosis of the left main in \nwhom IVUS or FFR will be performed for confirmation of lesion severity. In this case, since the \npatient will be randomized in the catheterization laboratory after IVUS or FFR, ADP antagonist \npre-loading is permitted but is not mandatory; if the patient randomizes to PCI, however, and had \nnot been preloaded, ADP antagonist preloading must be administered within 2 hours post PCI. In \ncase of preloading, the following schedule is recommended: \n \n\n\u2022 clopidogrel 600 mg >6 hrs before PCI, or 300 mg >12 hrs before PCI (even if the subject is \non chronic ADP antagonist therapy); or \n\n\u2022   prasugrel 60 mg >1 hr before PCI (even if the subject is on chronic ADP antagonist therapy); \nor \n\n\u2022 ticagrelor with dosing per labeling >1 hr before PCI (even if the subject is on chronic ADP \nantagonist therapy) if approved by the local regulatory authorities during the randomization \nperiod of this protocol. \n\nPre-PCI statin therapy. Recent randomized trials62, 63,64, 65, 66 have demonstrated that high dose \nstatin therapy decreases PCI-related myonecrosis in subjects undergoing stent implantation, \nwhether or not the subject is already taking chronic statin therapy.  Therefore, in the absence of \nabsolute contraindications to statin use (e.g. severe allergy with prior use), it is strongly \nrecommended to give the statins 12 hours in advance (at least one dose), but in all cases at least 1 \nhour  before the PCI, regardless of LDL level and history of prior statin use. \n\u2022   atorvastatin 80 mg \n\u2022   rosuvastatin 40 mg \nThe above statin regimens are required per the protocol. In certain circumstances, sites may not \nbe able to follow the protocol required statin regimen.  In these cases, the site must agree to an \nalternative regimen with the sponsor in writing prior to randomizing any patients.  Failure to \nprospectively document and obtain approval of the alternative therapy will lead to the assessment of \na protocol deviation. \n \n\nOther medications.  The use of other medications prior to PCI (e.g. beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors) \nis left to the discretion of the treating physicians. \n \n\n7.2.3. Pre-CABG Medication \nIt is strongly recommended that subjects are treated with aspirin, statins, and antihypertensive \nmedications prior to surgical revascularization. For subjects on clopidogrel, prasugrel, or  \nticagrelor prior to CABG, these agents should be discontinued and CABG postponed for at least \n5 days, 7 days or 5days, respectively, if the subject is stable. Subjects receiving amiodarone  \nprophylaxis should be loaded prior to surgery, and have their treatment continued for a minimum \nof five days after surgery. It is strongly recommended that ACE inhibitors be stopped sufficiently \nbefore surgery to ensure they are no longer effective at the time of surgery. \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 53 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n7.2.4. 12-Lead ECG \n \n12-lead ECGs must be collected only in the randomized cohort, at pre-procedure, within 24 \nhours post procedure, at discharge, and at one year follow-up. If the one year follow-up is \nperformed through phone contact, the mandatory ECG must be performed at a local institution \nand submitted to the investigative site.  In addition, 12-lead ECG should be recorded during \nclinical episodes of ischemia or other adverse cardiac event and included in the event source \ndocumentation of the subject. \n \n\n7.2.5. Laboratory Tests \n \nIn the randomized cohort, the following lab tests will be required pre-procedure: HbA1c, CK- \nMB, hemoglobin, WBC, platelet count and serum creatinine, whereas hsCRP and BNP are \nhighly recommended. \n \n\nInitial screening must show that CK-MB is within normal limits.  If the subject has had a recent \nMI and the troponin level is still >ULN, the CK-MB must have fallen to within normal limits to \nqualify the subject for randomization. If the CK-MB is still elevated the subject is not eligible for \nrandomization until the CK-MB has fallen to <ULN. Cardiac markers must be measured in all \nsubjects at baseline and twice within 24 hours following the revascularization procedure: at 12 \u00b1 \n2 hours (i.e. 10-14 hours) and at 24 \u00b1 2 hours (i.e. 22-26 hours) post procedure or at discharge if \nsooner. In addition, with any significant new clinical episodes of angina or adverse cardiac \nevents, cardiac markers should be repeated and followed for 6-18 hours post ischemia. CK-MB \nlevels must be used to assess baseline entry criteria and post procedure myonecrosis. Either CK- \nMB or Troponin I or T levels may be used to assess myonecrosis >48 hours post procedure. \n \n\nNote: Discharge is considered when subject leaves the treating or referral hospital. \n \n\n7.2.6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction \n \nLeft ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) must be assessed at baseline within 14 days prior to \nrandomization, either by echocardiography, MRI, or contrast left ventriculography. For registry \npatients this is only recommended. \n\n7.2.7. Angiography \n \nBaseline angiography of the target vessel(s) will be completed as per the Angiographic Core Lab \nProtocol. (Refer to Section 23, Appendix H.) \n\n7.2.8. IVUS / FFR \n \nPrior to randomization, all subjects with an angiographically intermediate left main lesion (\u226550 -\n<70 DS% by consensus visual assessment by the Heart Team) without noninvasive evidence of a \nhemodynamically significant left main lesions must undergo additional invasive investigation \nafter informed consent such as IVUS (preferred) or FFR to document lesion severity.

TIA/Stroke Questionnaire \n \nAll patients randomized into the EXCEL RCT will have a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) \nassessment conducted by mRS-trained personnel at baseline and each visit and telephone \ninterview.  Additionally, the site research coordinator will evaluate each subject at 30 days, 6 \nmonths, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 Y follow-up time points and at the primary endpoint follow-up time \npoint (either at annual follow-up or at subject contact for primary endpoint AE check) using a \nTransient Ischemic Attack (TIA)/Stroke Questionnaire and mRS disability questions (Appendix J).   \nThis questionnaire is the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) validated \nquestionnaire used in Abbott Vascular\u2019s CREST clinical trial.  The disability questions are \nadapted from a structured interview developed for stroke patients.  If a subject\u2019s response to this \nquestionnaire indicates a possible stroke or a change in the mRS, then a vascular neurologist/ \nstroke specialist/mRS certified personnel blinded to the treatment type will confirm the mRS \nscale, determine whether a stroke has occurred and determine the stroke severity using the \nNIHSS TIA/Stroke Questionnaire.  If a new stroke is diagnosed at the site, the investigators at \nthe site will prepare a short narrative that describes the findings that support the diagnosis.  All \nstroke events will be adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC). Furthermore, if there is \nan increase in the mRS by one or more points noted at any visit, then an evaluation will be carried \nout to determine if a stroke or other outcome event has occurred. \n \n\nPost procedure, if a patient is diagnosed and adjudicated with a stroke event by the Clinical \nEvents Committee (CEC), a disability assessment will be performed at least 90 days after the \ndiagnosis of stroke using the mRS assessment instrument. \n \n\n7.2.10. QoL Questionnaire \n \nSubjects in the QoL substudy of the randomized trial should complete the Quality of Life (QoL) \nquestionnaires after being determined to be eligible for randomized study participation but prior to \nrandomization.  Subjects who have intermediate lesions who require an additional angiogram to \ndetermine eligibility should complete the QoL questionnaire prior to the additional angiogram in \ncase the randomization assignment is to PCI and the angiogram procedure continues into the PCI \ntreatment without leaving the catheterization laboratory. \n \n\nDisease-specific QoL will be assessed using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) and the \nLondon School of Hygiene Dyspnea Questionnaire in 1800 selected patients.  Mental health and \ndepression will be assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).  Generic health \nstatus will be assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short Form (SF-12), and \nhealth utilities will be assessed using the EuroQoL (EQ-5D) with U.S.-specific weights.  These \nmeasures will be assessed using standardized, written questionnaires at baseline (prior to \nrandomization), 1 month, 12 months, 3 years, and 5 years.  Questionnaires will be presented in \neach subject\u2019s native language using culturally-validated translations.  When an appropriate \ntranslation does not exist for the instrument, it will be omitted from the specific country but the \nremainder of the questionnaires will still be administered. Data entry for each questionnaire into \nthe study database will be the responsibility of an appropriate contract research organization \n(CRO). \n \n\nSee Section 17, Appendix B. for details regarding Quality of Life and U.S. Health Economics \nSub-Studies. \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 55 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n7.2.11. Resource Utilization \n \nData on cardiovascular-specific resource utilization will be collected prospectively for each \nrandomized U.S. subject for the index hospitalization and the full follow-up period for all \nsubjects using standardized case report forms. \n \n\n7.2.12. IVRS Randomization \n \nAfter informed consent has been obtained and all eligibility criteria have been confirmed, the \ncentral allocation service (Interactive Voice Response System:  IVRS) should be contacted \n(ICON Clinical Research, L.P.). Prior to randomization, the IVRS will prompt the study \ncoordinator to provide the subject\u2019s SYNTAX score and diabetes status (whether or not medically \ntreated for stratification purposes). The IVRS will randomize the subject to either PCI with the \nXIENCE stent (depending on availability) or CABG treatment on a one to one basis using a \nrandomized block design.  Randomization will be stratified by the presence vs. absence of \nmedically treated diabetes, SYNTAX score <23 vs. \u226523, and study center. Patients with \nsignificant ULMCA disease who are otherwise not eligible for randomization should be entered \ninto the Universal Registry through the IVRS, ideally prior to revascularization. \n \n\n7.3.         Procedure- PCI \n \nIt is recommended that the treatment for subjects randomized to PCI will be according to the \nproduct labeling and instructions for use as well as the following instructions: \n \n\n7.3.1. General Considerations \n \n\u2022 Procedural \u201cstaging\u201d in PCI subjects is defined as a planned elective second PCI procedure \n\nat a separate setting to optimally complete the PCI.  Given the complexity of the ULMCA \nsubjects randomized in this clinical trial, it is anticipated that a substantial proportion of PCI \nsubjects may fall into the category of staged procedures.  The criteria for staging are left to \nthe operator\u2019s best judgment, and there is expected variability among operators and sites.  In \ngeneral, the decision to stage is based on the overall extent and complexity of coronary  \n\n \n disease, the case complexity (intra-procedure difficulty encountered by the operator), the \n\nduration of the procedure, assessment of radiation exposure, the total volume of contrast \nutilized, the clinical stability of the subject, and other subject-related factors (diabetes, renal \nfunction, etc.). The recommended timing of a planned elective staged second PCI procedure \nis optimally within 2 weeks post index procedure, but in all subjects it is strongly \nrecommended that it be completed within 4 weeks post index procedure. \n\n \n\nThe reason(s) for the staged procedure must be documented in the eCRF and source \ndocuments. Furthermore, the need for staging, and all specific lesions planned to be treated \nduring the staged procedure should be declared beforehand in the eCRF at the time of initial \nbaseline procedure. \n\n \n\nUnless otherwise planned, stented segment(s) treated during the initial baseline procedure \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 56 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\nshould not be treated again during the staged procedure. If the e-CRF from the first procedure \ndid not indicate that such re-intervention was planned, the re-PCI will be considered to be \nclinically indicated, and will be analyzed as an event (although not necessarily ischemia- \nrelated \u2013 the Clinical Events Committee will make this determination). \n\n \n\nOnly randomized study stents should be used during staged procedures, if possible. During a \nstaged  procedure  the  same  study  assessments  (such  as  ECG  and  cardiac  biomarker \ncollection) apply as during the baseline procedure. All subjects must be taking the protocol \nrequired post ULMCA medications (such as aspirin and ADP antagonists) prior to staged \nprocedure. The staged procedures will not affect the original follow-up schedule. \n\n\u2022 Hemodynamic support for PCI subjects with ULMCA lesions is usually not required but \nthere is significant variability in the perceived need for hemodynamic support among \nexperienced operators and sites.  Criteria for required hemodynamic support may include \nsystemic hypotension, severe pulmonary hypertension, severely reduced ejection fraction, \nextreme anatomic complexity (e.g. severely calcified left main lesion with intended use of \nrotational atherectomy), and/or subject instability before or during the procedure.  The \ndecision regarding the use hemodynamic support, either elective and planned or urgently \nrequired due to subject instability, and the type of support device is left to the operator\u2019s best \njudgment. \n\n \n\n\u2022 The choice of vascular access for PCI (e.g. femoral or radial) is left to the operator\u2019s best \njudgment. \n\n\u2022 The choice and use of vascular closure devices is left to the operator\u2019s best judgment. \n \n\n7.3.2. Optimal ULMCA PCI \u2013 General Considerations \n \n\u2022 Determination of ULMCA lesion severity. At the time of the PCI procedure, all ULMCA \n\nlesions which appear visually to be <70% stenotic (even if the angiographic stenosis \nappeared to be \u226570% in severity on the earlier qualifying angiogram), should not be treated \nwith PCI unless there is evidence of ischemia or morphologic severity defined as either: \n\u25e6 noninvasive functional evidence of ischemia in the territory of the lesion (not explained \n\nby another coronary stenosis), and/or \n\u25e6    IVUS minimal luminal area \u22646.0 mm2 (see IVUS procedural guidelines), and/or \n\u25e6    FFR \u22640.80 (see FFR procedural guidelines). \n\n \n\nIf the subject has been randomized to PCI and the ULMCA stenosis is no longer believed to \nbe significant by these criteria, PCI should in most cases be performed of other significant \nlesions, but the ULMCA should not undergo intervention. Exceptions might include cases in \nwhich there is ostial LAD or LCX disease abutting the borderline left main lesion which \nmust be treated; when the left main stenosis is rapidly progressive on the basis of serial \nangiograms; or when the left main lesion is irregular or disrupted in appearance or has other \nhigh risk features for continued medical therapy. Whether or not the ULMCA is treated, once \nrandomized, the subject will remain in the randomized trial by intention to treat. \n\n \n\n\u2022 In subjects with \u201cother coronary disease\u201d outside of the ULMCA complex, the following \ntreatment sequences are recommended: \n\u25e6 If LAD and/or LCX disease is present, treat the LAD and/or LCX first (distal to proximal, \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 57 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\nas per usual PCI practice), unless the severity of the LM stenosis (e.g. >70% stenosis) \nrequires primary treatment of the LM first. \n\n\u25e6 If the ULMCA lesion is critical (e.g. >90% visually assessed stenosis or clinical \ninstability), treat the ULMCA first, either with balloons or definitive stenting as \nrandomized to insure subject safety. \n\n\u25e6 If the RCA has a severe culprit lesion in a large vessel and the ULMCA stenosis is <70%, \nthe operator may choose to treat the RCA before the ULMCA lesion; otherwise the \nULMCA lesion should usually be treated before the RCA. \n\n\u25e6 Chronic total occlusions (CTOs) should usually be treated after completion of the \nULMCA lesion (frequently as a planned second staged procedure). \n\n\u2022 Left main lesion preparation, defined as pre-treatment with balloons or other approved \ndevices (including rotational atherectomy for heavily calcified vessels), of the ULMCA \ncomplex is left to the operator\u2019s best judgment, but is strongly recommended.  Direct stenting \nof the ULMCA is strongly discouraged. \n\n\u2022 Adequate lesion pre-dilatation requires dilatation with a balloon no smaller than 0.5 mm \nsmaller than the distal RVD. Furthermore, when moderate or greater calcification is evident \nby either angiography or IVUS, all possible steps should be taken to ensure that full balloon \nexpansion with the anticipated final stent size is achievable before the stent is implanted. \nThis might require pre-dilatation with a non-compliant balloon sized 1:1 to the distal RVD \n(either alone or in conjunction with a cutting/scoring balloon and/or high-speed rotational \natherectomy), and/or successful passage of an IVUS catheter after pre-dilatation \ndemonstrating adequate lumen dimensions.  Strong consideration should be given to \nadditional pre-dilatation or lesion preparation if an IVUS catheter will not cross the lesion \nprior to stent implantation. \n\n\u2022 To provide continuous branch vessel access and to ensure subject safety, two separate \nguidewires must always be in place in both the LAD and LCX during treatment of a distal \nLM bifurcation lesion. \n\n\u2022 In subjects randomized to PCI, only the commercially available XIENCE stent can be used \u2013  \n this is mandatory. The XIENCE DES should be used if it is available in the appropriate \n\ndiameter and length. The XIENCE PRIME DES is available in diameters from 2.25 mm to \n4.0 mm and lengths from 8 mm to 38 mm (see Table 2-4 for size matrix).  The XIENCE V \nDES is available in diameters from 2.25 mm to 4.0 mm and lengths from 8 mm to 28 mm \n(see Table 2-3 for size matrix).  The XIENCE Xpedition is available in diameters from 2.25 \nmm to 4.0 mm and lengths from 8 mm to 38 mm (see Table 2-5 for size matrix). The \nXIENCE PRO DES (for OUS use only) is available in diameters from 2.25 mm to 4.0 mm \nand lengths from 8 mm to 38 mm (see Table 2-6 for size matrix).  The 4.0 mm diameter \nXIENCE stent can be post-dilated up to 4.5 mm diameter using appropriately sized balloons. \nIt is strongly recommended not to overlap XIENCE V stents due to the absence of longer \nXIENCE V stent lengths to match the XIENCE PRIME, XIENCE Xpedition or XIENCE \nPRO (for OUS use only) 33 and 38 mm stent lengths. \n\n\u2022 The following techniques are strongly recommended to optimally deploy the XIENCE DES: \n\u25e6    good lesion preparation with balloons or other approved devices as above \n\u25e6    selection of the stent diameter according to the distal reference vessel diameter (1.0 \u2013 \n\n1.1 : 1.0 ratio) \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 58 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n\u25e6 deployment of the XIENCE PRIME (at 8 to 18 atm), XIENCE Xpedition (at 8 to 18 atm), \nXIENCE PRO (at 8 to 18 atm, for OUS use only) or XIENCE V DES (at 8 to 16 atm) \n\n\u25e6 optional post-dilation using properly sized non-compliant balloons at  high pressures \ncontained within the stent margins, especially if there is an area of incomplete expansion \n(noted by IVUS or as a \u201cwaist\u201d on the deployment balloon or angiographic narrowing \npost-deployment). \n\n \n\nIn the rare case where a XIENCE stent is not available in the size and/or length needed, or \nthe XIENCE stent cannot be delivered to the target site, subjects should be managed per the \nstandard of care at the hospital site in the best interest of the subject. \n\n \n\nIVUS guidance for ULMCA PCI is found in Section 20.2 \n\u2022 Devices not approved by the FDA may not be used during the procedure. \n \n\n7.3.3. Left Main Ostial and Shaft Lesions \n \n\u2022 After adequate lesion preparation and in the optimal deployment view, a single stent should \nbe implanted in the ULMCA, beginning at the ostium (placed 1-2 mm in the aorta to ensure aorto-\nostial coverage) and ending in either the ULMCA segment if the ULMCA length is >8 mm, or \n\u201ccrossing-over\u201d to end in either the LAD (usually) or LCX (less commonly) if the ULMCA length \nis <8 mm. \n\u2022 Post-dilatation with short high pressure (\u226518 atm) non-compliant balloons within the stent \nmargins is strongly recommended unless IVUS guidance indicates flush apposition and \nappropriate CSA (minimum CSA >8.5 mm2). \n \n\n7.3.4. Left Main Distal Bifurcation Lesions \n \n\u2022 A single stent crossover provisional technique is strongly recommended whenever possible \nwith the stent size selected to match the distal branch reference vessel (usually the LAD). If the \nside branch origin (usually the ostial LCX) has a residual stenosis <50% with TIMI 3 flow, and \nwithout a significant dissection, the decision to dilate the side branch is left to the discretion of \nthe operator.   If the decision is made not to dilate the side branch, a short (usually 8 mm) \nnon-compliant balloon contained within the left main segment should be used to fully expand the \nstent in the left main.  If there is uncertainty concerning the adequacy of side branch patency, an \nFFR determination is recommended, with a value of \u22640.80 indicating that side branch dilatation \nshould be performed.67, 68  If there is significant (>50%) stenosis or other signs of sub-optimal \nside branch appearance (e.g. dissection or FFR \u22640.80), it is strongly recommended to utilize \nkissing balloons after a single stent crossover technique, with long inflations of 60 seconds or \nmore if tolerated by the subject to attempt to manage the ostial LCX without additional stent \nimplantation. The technique of post-stent kissing balloons in this circumstance includes the use of \nnon-compliant short balloons in both branches with balloon sizing according to the distal  \nreference  vessel  diameters,  initial dilation of the side branch balloon at moderate pressures (8 to \n12 atm), followed by simultaneous inflation/deflation of both balloons (8 to 12 atm). \n \n\n\u2022 Guidelines for a provisional second stent: After single stent crossover stent placement, if the \nbranch vessel origin appears sub-optimal based upon angiographic, FFR or IVUS \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 59 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\nassessment, subsequent kissing balloon angioplasty is strongly recommended as above.

The use of kissing balloons after provisional second stents is strongly \nrecommended. The technique of post-stent kissing balloons in this circumstance includes the \nuse of non-compliant short balloons in both branches with balloon sizing according to the \ndistal  reference  vessel  diameters,  initial  dilation  with  the  side  branch  balloon  at  high \npressures (\u226518 atm), followed by simultaneous inflation and deflation of both balloons \n(8-12 atm). \n\n\u2022 The decision to use a primary two stent technique strategy rather than a single crossover \nstent technique should be considered when the side branch (usually the LCX) is large \n(>3 mm), with significant disease (by angiographic or IVUS assessment) and lesion length \n>5 mm, or when there are other special anatomic considerations (e.g. heavy calcification). \nConsidering the anatomic variability of the distal LM bifurcation, the final decision to select \na primary two stent technique strategy is left to the operator\u2019s best judgment. The choice of a \nparticular distal bifurcation stent strategy is also left to the operator\u2019s best judgment and may \ninclude T-stenting, TAP, crush, or culotte stent techniques. A \u201cV-stent\u201d distal bifurcation \nstent approach is discouraged unless the ULMCA segment is very short, or there is focal \nULMCA distal bifurcation disease which extends into the branch vessel origins and the \nprocedure can be completed with a short segment (<3 mm) of two stents in the distal \nULMCA segment. \n\n\u2022 The use of kissing balloons after primary two stent technique is strongly recommended. The \ntechnique of post-stent kissing balloons in this circumstance includes the use of non- \ncompliant short balloons within the margins of the stents in both branches with balloon sizing \naccording to the distal reference vessel diameters, initial dilation of the side branch balloon at  \n\n  high pressures (\u226518 atm), followed by simultaneous inflation/deflation of both balloons (8- \n  12 atm). \n \n\n7.3.5. Optimal PCI of Other Coronary Lesions \n \n\u2022 For all \u201cborderline or intermediate non left main lesions\u201d (40-70% diameter stenosis by \n\nangiographic visual estimate), it is strongly recommended to confirm the lesion significance \nbefore treatment using FFR evaluation (preferred) or IVUS assessment (alternate).  In the \ncase of FFR this may need to be performed after successful stenting of the left main stenosis. \n(See Section 20)  Non left main lesions which are not severe either by angiographic, IVUS or \nFFR assessment should not undergo PCI. \n\n\u2022 For all non-left main lesions, IVUS guidance pre-treatment and assessment post-treatment \nto optimize lumen dimensions is recommended (especially for LAD lesions, with exceptions \nincluding distal lesions, tortuous vessels, or focal proximal lesions in large vessels).

(See Section 20. Appendix E.) \n \n\n\u2022 The liberal use of additional guidewires to protect side branches during complex angioplasty is \nrecommended as per the operator\u2019s best judgment. \n \n\n\u2022 Lesion preparation using balloons or any approved device is left to the operator\u2019s best \njudgment to be able to deliver the stent to the lesion and achieve full stent expansion. \n\n\u2022 It is mandatory that only a XIENCE stent is used for all non left main coronary lesions \nwhich are stented. If the XIENCE stent is either unavailable or cannot be delivered to lesion \nsite, it is recommended to follow standard of care at the site. \n\n\u2022 Liberal use of short non-compliant post-dilation balloons (\u226518 atm) within the stent margins \nof all stents is recommended to optimize luminal results, unless IVUS otherwise shows \noptimal expansion and lumen dimensions. \n\n\u2022 Criteria for optimal PCI of ULMCA and non LM lesions are as follows: visual diameter \nstenosis <10% is acceptable (0% stenosis is strongly preferred), and there should be no edge \ndissections > type A, with no residual edge stenosis >20% by angiography. \n\n\u2022 Specific lesion categories, such as chronic total occlusions, bifurcation disease, diffuse \nlesions, thrombus-containing lesions or heavily calcified lesions should be treated according to \nthe operator\u2019s best judgment using acknowledged best PCI practices. In situations of \ndiffuse disease or tandem lesions it is recommended to use single long stents rather than \neither two shorter side-by-side or overlapping stents. A liberal staging strategy should be \nused, especially for subjects with complex double vessel or triple vessel disease, or if high \ndoses of radiation and/or contrast are used in the first procedure. Refer to Section 7.3.1. \n\n7.3.6. Intra-procedure Adjunctive Pharmacology \n\u2022 Either bivalirudin, unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin is acceptable \n\n(according to proper dose guidelines, adjusted for renal insufficiency). Bivalirudin is \nrecommended for this protocol based on a recent large scale study in more than 127,000 \nsubjects demonstrating a reduction in mortality with bivalirudin compared to heparin + \nGPIIb/IIIa inhibitors across a broad cross section of subjects undergoing PCI.69 Moreover, \ntwo additional recent studies in more than 1.5 million patients and 13,500 patients have \n\n shown that bivalirudin results in a marked reduction in major bleeding compared to other \n anticoagulants,  especially  when  used  in  concert  with  vascular  closure  devices. 70 , 71\n\n \n\n Bivalirudin should be administered as an intravenous bolus of 0.75 mg/kg and an infusion of \n 1.75 mg/kg/hr, started 5 minutes before PCI.  In patients with an estimated creatinine \n clearance <60 ml/min (as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula), the bolus dose of \n bivalirudin is unchanged, but the infusion dose should be reduced as follows: \n \n \n\nCalculated Clcr \n\n(ml/min) \nBivalirudin \n\nHalf-life (min) \nReduction in Infusion \n\nDosage (%) \n\n>90 25 0 \n\n60-90 22 0 \n\n30-59 34 20 \n\n10-29 57 60 \n\n<10 210 90 \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 61 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n As a direct thrombin inhibitor, bivalirudin increases the activated clotting time (ACT). \n\nHowever, use of the ACT level to guide bivalirudin dosing has not been found to be helpful; \ni.e. high ACT levels have not correlated with bleeding, and low ACT levels have not \ncorrelated with lack of efficacy with bivalirudin. ACT levels are therefore not required in this \nprotocol. However, it is recommended that an ACT is drawn just to be certain that the \nbivalirudin bolus and infusion have been delivered. \n\n \n\n In  nearly  all  cases,  the  bivalirudin  infusion  should  be  discontinued  at  the  end  of  the \nprocedure. If manual compression is to be used, femoral sheaths may be removed in 2 hours \nwithout checking an ACT or a PTT level. Of course, hemostasis may be obtained at any \nearlier time by use of a vascular closure device, the use of which is per operator discretion. \n\n \n\n\u2022 If unfractionated heparin is used as a procedural anticoagulant, it is recommended that an \ninitial bolus of 60 U/kg be administered, with subsequent boluses titrated to an ACT of \n250 seconds. However, the exact manner of use of unfractionated heparin is left to the \ndiscretion of the operator and local practice. Low molecular weight heparin may be used as a \nprocedural anticoagulant as per local practice and expertise, but is not recommended in \nsubjects with an estimated creatinine clearance <60 ml/min. Fondaparinux is not permitted as \na procedural anticoagulant. Procedural anticoagulants should usually be discontinued at the \nend of the procedure, but in rare cases may be continued at low dose as per physician \ndiscretion (e.g. for subjects with an indwelling intra-aortic balloon pump). The routine use of \npost procedural low molecular weight heparin for prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis is \nnot permitted. \n\n7.3.7. GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors \n \nGP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are strongly discouraged in subjects adequately pre-loaded with an ADP \nantagonist (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor), especially if bivalirudin is used. GP IIb/IIIa \ninhibitors may be used, however, in subjects with large amounts of thrombus, or for thrombotic \nor ischemic complications arising during the procedure (provisional or bail-out use) \u2013 e.g. for \nrefractory thrombus or no reflow resistant to repeat balloon dilatation and intracoronary use of \nnitroprusside or calcium channel blockers in the absence of a mechanical complication. \nProvisional GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors may not be used for \u201csoft\u201d indications such as lesion haziness \nor a small dissection as their use in these situations will increase bleeding complications, without \nclear benefit. \n\n7.4.  Procedure \u2013 CABG \n \nThe treatment for subjects randomized to CABG is as follows: \n \n\n7.4.1 Optimal CABG Requirements \n \n\u2022 Conduct of Surgery.  Coronary artery bypass grafting may be performed with or without the \n\nassistance of cardiopulmonary bypass, depending on the expertise of the center. Robotic \nsurgery techniques may not be used. \n \n\nOn-pump, surgical revascularization may be performed with an arrested heart or beating \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 62 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\nheart strategy.  Cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass should be ascending aortic for \narterial return, unless there is ascending aortic atherosclerosis or dilatation (>4 cm in \ndiameter), and right atrial for venous drainage. In cases of aortic atherosclerosis or dilatation, \nan alternate arterial cannulation strategy must be performed (see below).  Cardiopulmonary \nbypass blood flow should be maintained at least at 2.0 liters/m2/minute.  Systemic arterial \nblood pressure should be at maintained at a minimum of 60 mm Hg during cardiopulmonary \nbypass, and should be increased in the elderly and in those with cerebrovascular disease to \nensure adequate cerebral blood flow. During cardiopulmonary bypass the subject\u2019s \ntemperature may be cooled or allowed to drift down as determined by local practice. Use of a \nsingle cross-clamp technique for subjects undergoing CABG on CPB is strongly \nrecommended and multiple applications of an aortic clamp is strongly discouraged. When \nweaning from cardiopulmonary bypass it is recommended that the subject be normothermic. \n \n\nSites will be advised to follow their own insulin protocols for glucose level management \nintra-and postoperatively if these are consistent with the STS practice guidelines. If no \nguidelines exist, then sites will be advised to follow an insulin protocol similar to the one \nincluded in Appendix I. \n \n\nIn off-pump and on-pump beating heart surgery, coronary stabilization devices must be used. \nCoronary artery exposure and cardiac manipulation may be performed with apical suction \npositioners and/or pericardial sutures. Intravascular shunts may be used to prevent ischemia \nand allow for hemostasis during performance of the distal anastomoses.  Proximal vessel \nloops may be used to obtain hemostasis during construction of the distal anastomoses or \nplacement of intravascular shunts.  Distal vessel loops are to be avoided whenever possible. \nThe use of a humidified blower during the performance of the distal anastomoses to improve \nvisibility is highly recommended.  Every effort should be made to keep the subjects \nnormothermic during off-pump revascularization. \n\n \n\nAfter completion of proximal and distal anastomoses, graft patency assessment is strongly \nrecommended with either transit time Doppler flow measurements or with intra-operative \nangiography with immunofluorescence or standard radiographic angiography.  If a bypass graft \nis determined to be functioning poorly, the graft should be evaluated and revised. \n\n\u2022 Aortic Assessment.  It is strongly recommended that intra-operative assessment of the \nascending aorta by transesophageal echocardiography and/or epi-aortic echocardiography be \nperformed.  Aortic assessment should be performed prior to manipulation, cannulation, or \nclamping of the ascending aorta.  If ascending aortic atherosclerosis or dilatation is identified, a \nsurgical strategy must be used that does not manipulate, cannulate, or clamp the \natherosclerotic or dilated aorta.  For on-pump revascularization a strongly recommended \noption is alternate site arterial cannulation (axillary or femoral artery) with no ascending \nclamping, and for off-pump revascularization a strategy with a no-touch aortic technique \nshould be implemented.  Hypothermic circulatory arrest with ascending aortic replacement \nshould be used as a last resort for subjects with ascending aortic atherosclerosis. Locally \napproved proximal aortic connectors and facilitators (that do not involve aortic clamping) \nmay be used to perform proximal anastomoses. \n\n\u2022 Cardioplegia for On-Pump, Arrested Heart Surgery. Intermittent, cold blood cardioplegia is \nthe preferred myocardial protection strategy for on-pump, arrested heart surgery.  However, \nintermittent cold crystalloid cardioplegia or continuous warm blood cardioplegia is allowed if \nlocal standard of care.  Cold blood cardioplegia should be administered initially at 10 to 15 \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 63 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\ncc/kg to arrest and protect the heart, and then re-administered every 20 to 30 minutes at a \nminimum of 5 cc/kg.  Delivery of cardioplegia should be initially antegrade to arrest the heart \nin the absence of important aortic insufficiency.  If important aortic insufficiency is present \nand antegrade delivery of cardioplegia is not feasible, cardioplegia should be administered \nretrograde to arrest the heart and additional right ventricular protection methods should be \nperformed, such as ice slush to the surface of the right ventricle and cardioplegia administered \nvia the completed bypass graft to the right coronary artery system.  During the remainder of \nthe cross-clamp period, cardioplegia may be administered antegrade, retrograde via a coronary \nsinus catheter, and/or via completed saphenous vein grafts.  If available, a nutrient rich hot \nshot given prior to removing the aortic cross-clamp is highly recommended. \n\n\u25e6 Conduit Selection. Arterial grafts are the preferred conduits for coronary revascularization. It \nis strongly recommended for all subjects to have the left internal thoracic artery used to \ngraft the left anterior descending coronary artery system. In most cases this may be the left \ninternal thoracic artery. In subjects less than seventy years of age, additional arterial grafts are \nhighly recommended. The right internal thoracic artery is the preferred second arterial graft, \nand should be used to graft the next most important and stenotic coronary artery system. It \nmay be used as an in-situ graft or free graft. Other arterial grafts that may be used in this study \ninclude the radial, in-situ gastroepiploic, and free inferior epigastric arteries. When using the \nradial artery as a bypass graft, it should be preferentially used to revascularize a left coronary \nartery system branch with severe (>70%) stenosis. The in-situ gastroepiploic artery may be \nused to graft severely stenotic (preferentially occluded) branches of the right coronary artery \nor posterior descending of a left dominant system. The inferior epigastric artery is best used as \na \u201cY\u201d or \u201cT\u201d graft. \n\n \n\nSaphenous vein grafts may be used for coronary revascularization in the study. Since \ninternal thoracic artery grafting of the left anterior descending is standard of care for surgical \nrevascularization, saphenous veins may be used to bypass the left anterior descending only \nwhen the left internal thoracic is an inadequate conduit. \n\n \n\nAlthough arterial grafts are the preferred conduit, each center should use a conduit \nrevascularization strategy that they are experienced and comfortable performing. When selecting \nconduits, the effects of native coronary competitive blood flow must be considered. \n \n\nDetails of non-use of arterial grafts and non-use of internal mammary artery grafts including the \nreasons for such non- use will be recorded in the EXCEL trial eCRF. \n \n\u2022 Intraoperative Transesophageal Echocardiography Assessment. It is highly recommended \n\nthat intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography be performed prior to cannulation to \nassess left ventricular function, cardiac valves, and ascending aorta. For subjects with \nintraoperatively identified important valve dysfunction or aortic aneurysmal disease, the \nsurgeon may repair or replace the valve or aorta as deemed necessary. Intraoperatively, after \ncoronary revascularization is complete, it is strongly recommended that transesophageal \nechocardiography be used to assess for new ventricular wall abnormalities. If new ventricular \nwall abnormalities are identified, then the bypass graft supplying that myocardial area should \nbe evaluated and revised if necessary. \n\n \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 64 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n7.5. Completeness of Revascularization \n \nAll ischemic myocardial areas, such as those subtended by coronary arteries with visually \nassessed \u226550% diameter stenosis, should be revascularized. \n \n\nFor subjects randomized to PCI:  In prior PCI vs.  CABG trials, the determination of and \nexecution of \u201ccompleteness of revascularization\u201d strategy has been an important consideration. \nIn this trial, the philosophical approach is to perform PCI of all significant ischemia-\nproducing lesions as opposed to all lesions which appear to be significant by angiographic visual \nassessment, especially if the angiographic lesions are 40-70% diameter stenosis.  Moreover, it is \nstrongly recommended that PCI is performed only in ischemia-producing lesions, in most cases \nnot treating non ischemia-producing lesions. Ischemia-producing lesions are defined as those \nwhich (1) are \u226570% angiographic diameter stenosis (visually assessed), or if <70% diameter \nstenosis, are either (2a) associated with noninvasive functional evidence of ischemia in the \nterritory of the lesion (not explained by another coronary stenosis), and/or (2b) intra-procedure \nFFR \u22640.80 (note FFR procedure guidelines), and/or (2c) IVUS minimal luminal area \u22644.0 mm2 \n\n(for non left main lesions) with plaque burden >60% (note IVUS procedure guidelines). \n \n\nFor subjects randomized to CABG: Since all subjects in this study have important ULMCA \nstenosis, according to contemporary surgical standards, all subjects should have at least one \nbypass graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery system and a second graft to \ncircumflex coronary artery system. All coronary arteries with \u226550% stenosis and \u22651.5 mm in \ndiameter should be revascularized. \n\n7.6. Post-Procedure Assessments and Medications \n \nFollowing the procedure, mandated medication is specified below; beyond that, the subject will \nbe treated in accordance with hospital standard of care. \n \n\n7.6.1. Laboratory Assessments \n \nThe laboratory assessments need to be obtained according to the Schedule of Events included in \nSection 7.1. \n \n\n7.6.2. Post-PCI Medications \n \nAspirin. Mandatory dosing with aspirin will be \u226575 mg post-PCI per day in the hospital, and \nthen aspirin \u226575 mg per day indefinitely.  Daily aspirin must be given for the duration of the \ntrial. Aspirin must not be discontinued for CABG or other reasons unless absolutely necessary. \n \n\nADP antagonists. Chronic daily ADP antagonist therapy is mandated for at least one year after \nPCI in subjects who received a ULMCA DES, with the choice of agent left to the discretion of \nthe investigator, either: \n \n\n \u2022 clopidogrel 75 mg per day, or 150 mg per day for 7-30 days then reduced to 75 mg per day, \nunless clopidogrel hyporesponsive; \n\n \u2022 prasugrel 10 mg per day (5 mg per day may be used in patients <60 kg in body weight or in \nother circumstances, but in general  the 5 mg per day prasugrel dose is discouraged given \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 65 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\nminimal clinical experience with this prescribed amount); \n \n\n \u2022 ticagrelor per labeling and recommended guidelines if approved by the local regulatory \nauthorities during the treatment period of this protocol. \n \n\n\u201cHypo-responders\u201d to anti-platelet therapy based on point of care testing are managed according to \nlocal standard of care.  A daily ADP antagonist must be given for at least one year in the \nabsence of major complications, and is recommended for the duration of the trial in the absence of \nmajor bleeding or other complications. \n \n\nADP antagonists must not be discontinued within the first year after DES implantation unless \nabsolutely necessary for major bleeding, major trauma, or major surgery necessitating \ndiscontinuation of antiplatelet therapy (e.g. intracranial surgery).  Many surgeries can safely be \nperformed while the subject is on dual antiplatelet therapy.  If a subject on dual antiplatelet \ntherapy requires surgery, strong consideration should be given to performing the surgery without \nantiplatelet agent discontinuation.  If a particular dual antiplatelet therapy must be discontinued, a \nGP IIb/IIIa bridging strategy up until the time of surgery may be considered, followed by re- \nloading of the ADP antagonist as soon as possible post surgery. \n \n\nStatin therapy. See Section 22.2 for recommendations for statin use after PCI. \n \n\nOther medications. For medication use post PCI, see Section 22.2. \n \n\n7.6.3. Post-CABG Medications \n \nAspirin (\u226575 mg) must be given within six hours after surgery intravenously, orally, rectally, or \nvia a nasogastric tube if there is no important bleeding (\u226450 cc/hr), and daily for the duration of \nthe trial.  All subjects should be treated postoperatively with daily statins and beta-blockers, \nunless contraindicated, see Section 22.2. \n \n\nBeta-blockers are recommended for prophylaxis of post-operative atrial fibrillation.  Amiodarone \nmay be considered for subjects in whom beta-blockers are contraindicated and as therapy for \npostoperative sinus rhythm control.  For subjects receiving amiodarone prophylaxis for atrial \nfibrillation, amiodarone should be continued for five days postoperatively. \n \n\nIt is recommended that ACE inhibitors be given in subjects with depressed left ventricular \nfunction. \n \n\nClopidogrel is not required but may be administered as per local standard of care in subjects with \nsaphenous vein grafts or in those who underwent off-pump surgery. \n \n\n7.6.4. Post-Operative Atrial Fibrillation \u2013 CABG \n \nPost-operative atrial fibrillation should be treated with either rate control and anticoagulation, or \nchemical or electrical cardioversion.  Subjects being treated with rate control and anticoagulation \nshould be treated with warfarin and may be bridged with heparin as per local protocol.  Subjects \nundergoing cardioversion may undergo cardioversion without anticoagulation if the duration of \natrial fibrillation is less than 36 hours.

Laboratory Tests, ECGs, and Other Measures \n \nTests will be performed periodically on all subjects as follows (Section 7.1, Schedule of Events): \n \n\n8.2. Clinical Follow-up \n \nSubjects will have clinical follow-up as a telephone contact or office visit, at the time points listed \nbelow.  Day 0 is the date of the randomization assignment which can be on the same date or \nearlier than the date of the randomized procedure.  All adverse events (AE) will be recorded \nfrom Day 0.  Patient follow-up will occur from the day of randomized procedure as shown below. \nOffice visits are strongly recommended for the annual clinical follow-up.  If that is not possible, \nphone contact with subject or subject\u2019s local physician is acceptable.

Non study hospital related material will be collected and reviewed at the study \ncoordinating centers.  All follow-up angiograms must be collected (whether at the study hospital or \nan outside hospital) and sent to the angiographic core laboratory for independent analysis. \n \n\nThe following data will be collected at 30 days, 6 mo, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 \nyears follow-up time points (and potential 6-10 year visits).  \n \n\n \u2022 Data regarding adverse events (with related laboratory tests results), including but not limited \n to death, MI, stroke, TIA, bleeding, renal insufficiency, repeat revascularization procedures, \n repeat hospitalization for any reason, ECGs, details of any subsequent repeat coronary \n angiography and results of such, if applicable. \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 67 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n \u2022 Details of any subsequent coronary interventions (for example, repeat PCI or CABG).

Guidelines for Follow-up Non-Invasive Testing, Angiography and \n Reintervention \n\n \n\n8.3.1. Follow-up Non-Invasive Testing \n \nThe decision whether to perform routine stress testing after ULMCA treatment should depend on \nthe symptomatic state of the subject, as follows: \n \n\n \u2022 The asymptomatic subject.  Routine stress testing is strongly discouraged in the asymptomatic \n subject. \n\n \u2022 The subject with atypical symptoms.  Routine stress testing may be performed in the subject \n with atypical symptoms according to the discretion of the treating physicians, or such \n subjects may be treated conservatively. \n \n\n\u2022 The subject with typical angina or other progressive cardiac symptoms or signs.  Subjects \nwith typical cardiac symptoms or evidence of progressive heart disease should in most cases \nundergo repeat cardiac catheterization; stress testing should not be performed, especially in \nthe subject with possible recurrent disease in the left main stem. \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 68 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBecause of the risk of exercise-induced stent thrombosis, in no case should routine follow-up \nexercise stress testing be performed within 8 weeks after stent implantation. \n \n\nFollow-up echocardiography (without exercise) is not mandated by protocol but may be \nperformed at any time during follow-up per the discretion of the treating physicians.  Similarly, \nmultislice CT scanning but may be performed at any time during follow-up per the discretion of \nthe treating physicians.  However, the use of MSCT in accurately determining in-stent restenosis \nhas not been validated, and thus should in general not be used to guide decision making.  MSCT \nmay be useful, however, in determining bypass graft patency. \n \n\n8.3.2. Follow-up Angiography \n \nRoutine follow-up angiography in the asymptomatic subject is not permitted in this study.  Prior \nstudies have not demonstrated a benefit of routine follow-up angiography after ULMCA disease, \nand routine follow-up angiography can result in non clinically indicated revascularization \nprocedures (the \u201coculostenotic reflex\u201d).48,49  In the SYNTAX trial, routine follow-up angiography \nwas performed at 15 months in 268 surviving asymptomatic subjects with ULMCA disease \nrandomized to PCI with TAXUS PES vs. CABG.  In the PCI group, the mean late loss in the left \nmain stem with PES was only 0.2 mm, and thrombus was present in only 2 subjects (1%).  The \ncomposite rate of death, MI, stroke or repeat revascularization among PCI subjects undergoing \nroutine angiography was 13% at 15 months (compared to 15.8% in all PCI subjects at 12 months, \nincluding those who were symptomatic).  Numerous prior studies of drug-eluting stents in subjects \nwith ULMCA disease have demonstrated very low rates (<0.5%) of left main stent thrombosis,25, \n\n72 , 73 and no prior study of routine angiographic follow-up has been shown to improve \noutcomes after drug-eluting stents.  Routine angiographic follow-up after left main intervention is \nnot recommended by the current ACC/AHA PCI guidelines.27\n\n \n \n\n \nFor subjects who develop atypical chest pain or other symptoms that might reflect ischemia, it is \nstrongly recommended that a nuclear stress test, echocardiographic stress test, or MSCT scan be \nperformed, with subsequent angiography only for positive non-invasive results.  Valid indications \nfor follow-up angiography in the present study include any of the following: \n\u2022   the recurrence of typical angina; \n\n \u2022 a positive noninvasive study indicating moderate or severe ischemia, a significant decline in \n left ventricular function or progressive valve disease; \n\u2022   progressive heart failure or unstable arrhythmias; \n\u2022   cardiac arrest; \n\u2022   or other clinical conditions for which the treating physician believes follow-up angiography is \n\nindicated. \nThe reasons for follow-up angiography will be closely tracked in the case report form. \n \n\n8.3.3. Repeat Intervention (PCI or CABG) \n \nIn subjects who do undergo follow-up angiography, repeat PCI or CABG may only be performed \nwith evidence of ischemia, requiring one of the following to be present: \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 69 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022   \u226570% diameter stenosis of the treated or new lesions by visual angiographic assessment \n\u2022   In the case of a visually estimated diameter stenosis of \u226550% to <70%, either \n\n  \u25e6 evidence of definite ischemia in the territory of the diseased vessel by prior non-invasive  \n  stress testing with imaging evaluation showing ischemia in the questioned myocardial  \n  territory, and/or \n\n  \u25e6 IVUS minimal stent area \u22646.0 mm2 (see IVUS procedure guidelines) for left main lesions \n  or \u22644.0 mm2 for non-left main lesions, and/or \n \u25e6 intra-procedure FFR \u22640.80 (see FFR procedure guidelines). \n \n\nIVUS is preferred for assessment of left main lesions, and FFR is preferred for assessment of \nnon-left main lesions. In particular, after left main stent implantation, the ostial LCX may often \nappear significantly or even severely stenosed in the absence of symptoms or ischemia (\u201cpseudo- \nstenosis\u201d). All subjects with a suspected ostial LCX stenosis, regardless of the degree of \nangiographic severity (unless occluded), are highly recommended to have demonstrated an FFR \n\u22640.80 in the LCX prior to repeat revascularization, unless there is unequivocal evidence of lateral \nwall ischemia on non-invasive stress testing. \n \n\nIf repeat revascularization is to be performed, the decision whether to perform PCI or CABG \nshould be made according to the discretion of the treating physicians, ideally by local Heart \nTeam consensus. \n\n8.4. Adverse Events \n \nAn adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or \nuntoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other \npersons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device. \n \n\nNOTE 1: This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device or the \ncomparator. \n \n\nNOTE 2: This definition includes events related to the procedures involved. \n \n\nNOTE 3:  For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to investigational \nmedical devices. \n \n\nAn AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory \nfinding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) \nproduct, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. \n \n\nStable, chronic, pre-existing conditions are not to be reported as AEs.  However, worsening of a \npre-existing condition that occurs after a subject\u2019s participation in the trial is considered an AE \nand must be reported as such. \n \n\nPlanned procedures (scheduled prior to the index procedure) that occur after the index procedure \nare not considered AEs and are not to be reported as such.  Complications from such procedures, \nhowever, are considered AEs and must be reported. \n \n\nNon-cardiac related abnormal laboratory values will not be considered AEs unless: \n\u2022 the investigator determined that the value is clinically significant, \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 70 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 the abnormal lab value required intervention, or \n\u2022 the abnormal lab value required subject termination from the study. \n \n\nThe investigator should report the event(s) to the IRB/EC according to the institution\u2019s reporting \nrequirements.  \n \nAdverse Event Reporting \n \n\nThe Investigator will monitor the occurrence of adverse events for each subject during the course of \nthe study.  For the purpose of this protocol, the reporting of adverse events begins directly after \nrandomization.   All adverse events (AEs) reported by the subject, observed by the Investigator, or \ndocumented in medical records will be listed on the Adverse Event Case Report Forms. \n \n\nAdverse events will be monitored throughout the course of the \n\nstudy. Serious Adverse Events \n\nIf the adverse event meets any of the criteria below, it is regarded as a serious adverse event \n(SAE): \n \na) Led to a death, \nb) Led to a serious deterioration in health that either: \n    1) Resulted in a life-threatening illness or injury, or \n  2) Resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or \n  3) Required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or \n    4) Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent life threatening illness or injury or                        \n permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function. \n\nc) Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. \nd) An important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require \nhospitalization but may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, \nmay jeopardize the patient or subject and/or may require intervention to prevent one of the \noutcomes listed in this definition. \n\nNOTE 1: This includes device deficiencies that might have led to a serious adverse event if \na) suitable action had not been taken or b) intervention had not been made or c) if \ncircumstances had been less fortunate. These are handled under the SAE reporting system. \nNOTE 2: A planned hospitalization for pre-existing condition, or a procedure required by \nthe Clinical Investigation Plan, without a serious deterioration in health, is not considered \nto be a serious adverse event. \n\n \n\nThe investigator will report serious adverse events to the IRB/EC according to the institution\u2019s \nreporting requirements. \n \n\n8.4.1.

The date the site staff became aware of the \nserious adverse event must be recorded in the source document. The Investigator will further report \nthe event to the local IRB/EC according to the institution\u2019s IRB/EC reporting \nrequirements. \n \n\nSerious adverse events should be reported on the SAE Notification Form in the occurrence that \nthe electronic data capture (EDC) system is not available.  This does not replace the EDC \nreporting system.  All information must still be entered in the EDC system once the system is \nback to normal function. \n \n\nSerious adverse events that occurred in the user or persons other than the study subject should \nnot be entered in the EDC system, however they need to be reported on the fax notification form \ntitled SAE Notification Form. \n \n\n8.4.2. Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effects (USADE) \n \nUnanticipated serious adverse device effect (USADE) refers to any serious adverse effect on \nhealth or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if \nthat effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of \nincidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or \napplication), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the \nrights, safety, or welfare of subjects. \n \n\nAbbott Vascular requires the Investigator to report any USADE to the sponsor within 3 calendar \ndays of the investigator\u2019s knowledge of the event and to the IRB/EC per IRB/EC requirements. \n\n8.4.3. Device Relationship \n \nDetermination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that an investigational product or \ndevice caused or contributed to an adverse event is to be determined by the Investigator and \nrecorded on the appropriate CRF form.  Determination should be based on assessment of \ntemporal relationships, biologic plausibility, association (or lack of association) with underlying \ndisease, and presence (or absence) of a more-likely cause. \n\n8.5. Safety Monitoring \u2013 Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) \n \nThe Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is useful to ensure safety by reviewing cumulative \ndata from the clinical trial at pre-scribed intervals for the purpose of safety guarding the interest \nof trial participants.  The DSMB will serve as an advisory role.  The composition, guiding \npolicies, and operating procedures governing the DSMB are described in a separate DSMB \ncharter.  Based on safety data, the DSMB may recommend a modification to the protocol or that \nthe sponsor stops the clinical trial/investigation.  All final decisions regarding clinical trial/ \ninvestigation modifications, however, rest with the Sponsor. \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 72 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n8.6. Event Adjudication \u2013 Clinical Events Committee (CEC) \n \nThe Clinical Events Committee is comprised of qualified physicians who are not investigators in \nthe trial.  The Clinical Events Committee is responsible for adjudicating specified clinical \nendpoints based on the specific criteria used for the categorization of clinical events in the trial. \nThe composition, guiding policies, and operating procedures governing the CEC are described in a \nseparate CEC Manual of Operations. \n\n9.     STATISTICAL DESIGN AND ANALYSIS \n \nThis section describes the statistical considerations and analysis plans for the EXCEL trial.  The \nstudy is powered for both the primary and t h e  2  major secondary endpoints through an \nanticipated median follow-up of three years. \n \n\nIn general, binary variables will be summarized using counts, percentages, and exact 95% \nconfidence intervals. For continuous variables, percentiles, means, standard deviations, and 95% \nconfidence intervals for the mean using the Gaussian approximation will be calculated.  Time to \nevent data will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates and 95% confidence intervals. \nKaplan-Meier curves will be constructed for the primary and major secondary endpoints and \ndifferences in treatment will be tested using the difference in Kaplan-Meier failure rates on all \navailable data through 3-year follow-up at the time of the analysis (event driven analysis).  All \nprimary analyses will be measured from randomization onward and will be by intention to treat \naccording to randomized assignment, regardless of what therapy was actually received.  A \nsensitivity analysis will be performed on the primary endpoint defined from the index procedure \ndate.  The composite of all-cause mortality, MI, stroke (mRS\u22651 and increase by \u22651 from baseline), \nor unplanned revascularization for ischemia at 3 years post randomization will also be classified as \na sensitivity analysis.  Secondary analyses will be performed for the per protocol (PP) population \n(see also Section 9.1.5.2). \n \n\n9.1. Randomized Cohort \n\n9.1.1. Primary Endpoint \n \nThe primary endpoint is a composite of all-cause mortality, MI or stroke (mRS\u22651 and increase \nby \u22651 from baseline) at 3 years post randomization.  The primary endpoint will be estimated via \nKaplan-Meier failure rate measured from randomization and Greenwood\u2019s formula for estimating \nthe standard error.  The primary endpoint analysis will be conducted at the time when \napproximately 50% of the patients have reached the 3-year follow-up AND all patients have \nreached the 2-year follow-up, whichever time point is latest.  All available data through 3-year \nfollow-up will be used. \n \nThe analysis will also be performed at 3 years post index procedure, as a sensitivity analysis. \n \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 73 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n9.1.2.

All available data through 3-year follow-up will be used. \n\n \nSensitivity analyses will also be performed on all of the endpoints above from the index procedure \ndate.  The composite of all-cause mortality, MI, stroke (mRS\u22651 and increase by \u22651 from \nbaseline), or unplanned revascularization for ischemia at 3 years post randomization will also be \nclassified as a sensitivity analysis. \n \n\n9.1.3. Other Secondary Endpoints \n \nThe primary endpoint composite event rate (all-cause death, MI or stroke) and powered secondary \nendpoints at all time points other than median of 3 years will be analyzed as other secondary \nendpoints. \n \n\nTime points for all other secondary endpoints, unless specified otherwise, are in-hospital, 30 and \n180 days, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years post-procedure.   \n \nSurvival analysis techniques will be used to analyze the time-to-event variables.

Analysis of Other Endpoints \n \nFor binary variables, counts, percentages, and exact 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. \nFor continuous variables, percentiles, means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals \nfor the mean using the Gaussian approximation will be calculated.  P values will be reported for \ndescriptive purposes only.  Logistic regression and ANOVA models will be used to determine if \nthe data exhibit any trends.  For time-to-event variables, such as stent thrombosis, survival \ncurves will be constructed using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and log-rank test or Cox proportional \nhazard model results will be displayed for hypothesis-generating purposes only. \n \n\n9.1.8. Procedures for Accounting for Missing Data \n \nAlthough every effort will be made to minimize the amount of missing data, some loss to follow- \nup is unavoidable.  For time-to-event hypothesis tests, subjects will be censored at their last  \nknown follow-up.  The percentage of subjects with follow-up in each treatment arm will be \nsummarized.  The reasons for loss to follow-up will be collected and summarized.  All of these \ncomparisons will be performed using descriptive analyses only. \n\n9.1.9. Measures Taken to Minimize Bias \n \n\n9.1.9.1. Randomization \n \nAssessment of eligibility must be done prior to randomization.  Suitable subjects will be \nrandomized to procedure with PCI or CABG in a ratio of 1:1.  Randomization will be stratified \nby medically treated diabetes mellitus (diabetic vs. non-diabetic), SYNTAX score (<23 vs. \u226523) \nand by center. \n \n\nThe randomization will be managed by a central IVRS randomization.  See Section 7.2.12 for \nrandomization details.  Once randomized the subject is analyzed as part of the intent-to-treat \n(ITT) population. \n\n9.1.9.2. Clinical Events Committee and Angiographic Core \nLaboratory \n\n \nIn order to minimize bias, the clinical events committee (CEC) will assess specified clinical events \nper the Manual of Operation and independent core laboratories will assess imaging data. \n\n9.1.10.  Pooling Strategy \n \nAnalyses will be performed pooling data across study sites, study regions, and study stents. \nAdditional analyses will be conducted to evaluate the potential differences in treatment effect for \ndifferent sites/regions/study stents for the primary and powered secondary endpoints.

For continuous variables, \npercentiles, means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals for the mean using the \nGaussian approximation will be calculated.  The baseline features and treatment allocation of  \nsubjects in the registries will be compared to those in the randomized trial for descriptive \npurposes. \n \n\n9.3. Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and Treatment Costs \n \nHealth-related quality of life (HRQoL) and treatment costs will be assessed alongside the core \nclinical trial in about 1800 patients to evaluate the impact of the PCI and CABG strategies on a \nrange of relevant quality of life (QoL) domains and also to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the \ntwo treatment strategies. Details regarding the QoL and U.S. Health Economics Sub-Studies can \nbe found in Section 17, Appendix B. \n \n\n9.3.1. Endpoints \n \nQuality of life will be assessed using five patient reported outcome instruments administered at \nthe following time points: baseline, 1 month, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years.  Score ranges for each \ninstrument are as follows: SAQ: 0-100; PHQ-8: 0-24; SF-12: 0-100; EQ-5D: 0-1; Rose Dyspnea: \n0-4.  Means and standard deviations for these scores will be presented. \n \n\n9.3.2. Quality of Life \n \nHRQoL and functional status will be assessed using a combination of generic and disease- \nspecific measures selected to cover a broad range of health domains that may be affected by \ncoronary artery disease, its treatment, and its complications in about 1800 patients.  Disease- \nspecific QoL will be assessed using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ)77, 78 and the London \nSchool of Hygiene Dyspnea Questionnaire.79, 80   Mental health and depression will be assessed \nusing the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).81   Generic health status will be assessed using \nthe Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short Form (SF-12),82 and health utilities will be assessed \nusing the EuroQoL (EQ-5D) with U.S.-specific weights. 83 , 84   Further details regarding the \nrationale for selection of these instruments and specific analytic approaches are detailed in \nSection 17.  These measures will be assessed using standardized, written questionnaires at \nbaseline (prior to randomization), 1 month, 12 months, 3 years, and 5 years. \n \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 81 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n9.3.3. Economic Outcomes/Cost-Effectiveness \n \nData on cardiovascular-specific resource utilization and will be collected prospectively for the \nindex hospitalization and the full follow-up period for 1800 subjects using standardized case  \nreport forms.  Procedural costs will be assessed using a resource-based (e.g., \u201cbottom up\u201d) \napproach to convert standard measures such as procedural duration and utilization of \u201cbig ticket\u201d \nitems (e.g., stents, balloons, wires, contrast, etc.) into costs.  Other hospital costs will be assessed \nusing an \u201cevent-driven\u201d approach in which specific complications and outcomes (e.g. myocardial \ninfarction, bleeding complications, post-operative infection, etc.) are assigned standard costs based \non external data.  Additional costs will be assigned for follow-up hospitalizations and repeat \nrevascularization procedures, emergency room visits, outpatient diagnostic testing, cardiovascular \nmedications, and rehabilitation services (including skilled nursing services).  In each case, costs \nwill be assessed from the perspective of the U.S. healthcare system.  Finally, the cost and quality \nof life data will be integrated in order to perform a formal cost-effectiveness analysis.  The \nprimary analysis will be performed from the perspective of the U.S. healthcare system using a \nlifetime time horizon.  Secondary analyses will be performed from the perspective of other health \ncare systems with the collaboration of a local health economist. \n \n\nIf there are no significant differences in prognostically important endpoints (e.g., death, non-fatal \nMI, non-fatal stroke) between the two groups then the analysis will be based on the observed \ncost and QoL data from the trial itself (under the assumption that long-term survival would be \ncomparable for the two groups).  If there are differences in one or more of these endpoints (or \ntheir composite), however, then it will be important to account for differences in long-term \nsurvival between the two groups in the analysis. In this case, the data from the trial itself will be \nused along with external data in order to project long-term survival for each trial participant and \nuse these estimates in order to estimate differences in quality-adjusted life expectancy over each \nsubject\u2019s lifetime.  Consistent with current guidelines for health economic analyses, the trial data \nwill be used to calculate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per quality-adjusted year of \nlife gained) for the more expensive technique compared with the less expensive technique, and \nby comparing this ratio with those for other medical interventions, determine whether one \ntreatment strategy is preferred on economic grounds.85   Additional analyses will be performed \nusing intermediate, disease-specific endpoints including cost per major adverse cardiovascular \nevent avoided and cost per repeat revascularization avoided.86\n\n \n \n\nThe primary cost-effectiveness and quality of life analyses will be performed when all \nrandomized subjects have completed a minimum of 3-years of follow-up.  Although this time \nframe is slightly different from that for the main clinical endpoint, the longer follow-up duration \nfor the economic analysis will minimize the need for extrapolation beyond the observed data. \n \n\nAdditional details of the approaches to U.S.-specific costing and the formal cost-effectiveness \nanalysis are provided in Section 17.4 and Section 17.5. \n \n\n9.4.

RISK ANALYSIS \n \n\n15.1. Potential Risks - PCI \n \n\n15.1.1. Risks from Cardiac Catheterization, Stenting, and PTCA \n \nThere is extensive clinical and commercial experience worldwide with cardiac catheterization \nand interventional procedures and it is expected that the surgical and procedural risks will not be \nsignificantly different in this clinical trial.   For a list of anticipated adverse events from each \nstent system, refer to XIENCE PRIME, XIENCE V, XIENCE Xpedition and XIENCE PRO (for \nOUS use only) device IFU. \n \n\n \nSome of the complications of stenting procedure are: \n\u2022 Death, stroke, shock, kidney failure, squeezing of the heart due to accumulation of blood in \n\nthe sac around the heart (cardiac tamponade), access site infection,  decreased blood supply to \na part of the heart muscle, arms or leg, inadvertent injury to the aorta and/or its branches may \noccur in <2% of the patients. \n\n\u2022 Vascular complications at the access site that might need vessel repair including hematoma or \nhemorrhage, blockage of the coronary artery. \n\n\u2022 Rapid/ slow heartbeat, heart attack, development of blood clots, abnormal connection between \nan artery and a vein next to it (arterio-venous fistula), abnormal blood pressure, fluid \ndevelopment in the lungs (pulmonary edema), emergency or non-emergency surgery may \noccur in 2-5% of the patients. \n\n\u2022 Chest pain or discomfort, access site pain, allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to contrast agent \nor cobalt, chromium, nickel, tungsten, acrylic and fluoropolymers and drug reactions to \nantiplatelet drugs or contrast agent, repeat closure of the coronary artery over time may occur \nin 5-10% of the patients. \n\n\u2022 The rates of surgical and procedural risks for patients being treated for LM disease or Left \nMain Equivalent disease may be higher than the experience worldwide with cardiac \ncatheterization and interventional procedures. \n\n\u2022 The adverse events and potential device issues associated with the particular techniques (e.g., \nT- stent, TAP, mini-crush (reverse crush) or culotte bifurcation)) associated with the treatment \nof Left Main disease and allowed for in this study may result in adverse events or device issues \nnot previously identified.  As the study progresses and the experience with these techniques are \nbetter understood, the protocol may be updated with additional risks. \n\n \n \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 89 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n15.1.2.  Associated Risks of Everolimus \n\n \nThe risks of everolimus when used in a blood vessel (as in the Trial) are unknown. Zortress\u00ae, the \noral formulation of everolimus developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, has been \nevaluated in clinical trials and is approved in the United States for the prevention of organ \nrejection in adult kidney transplant recipients at low-moderate immunologic risk, at the dose of \n1.5 mg/day. \n \n\nOutside the U.S., Zortress is sold under the brand name, Certican\u00ae, in more than 70 countries. \nEverolimus is also approved in the United States under the name of Afinitor\u00ae for the treatment of \npatients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (cancer) after failure of treatment with sunitinib or \nsorafenib, at doses of 5 to 20 mg/day when taken by mouth.  The amount of drug in the blood \nfrom the XIENCE stent is several folds lower than obtained with oral doses (1.5 mg to 20 \nmg/day). \n \n\nThe list below includes the known risks of everolimus at the oral doses indicated above.  There \nmay be other potential adverse events that are unforeseen at this time. \n\n\u2022 Abdominal pain (including upper abdominal pain) \n\u2022 Anemia \n\u2022 Angioedema \n\u2022 Anorexia \n\u2022 Asthenia \n\u2022 Constipation \n\u2022 Cough \n\u2022 Delayed wound healing/fluid accumulation \n\u2022 Diarrhea \n\u2022 Dyslipidemia (including hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia) \n\u2022 Dyspnea \n\u2022 Dysgeusia \n\u2022 Dyspepsia \n\u2022 Dysuria \n\u2022 Dry skin \n\u2022 Edema (peripheral) \n\u2022 Epistaxis \n\u2022 Fatigue \n\u2022 Headache \n\u2022 Hematuria \n\u2022 Hyperglycemia (may include new onset of diabetes) \n\u2022 Hyperlipidemia \n\u2022 Hyperkalemia \n\u2022 Hypertension \n\u2022 Hypokalemia \n\u2022 Hypomagnesemia \n\u2022 Hypophosphatemia \n\u2022 Increased serum creatinine \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 90 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Infections and serious infections: bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections (may \ninclude herpes virus infection, polyoma virus infection which may be associated with BK \nvirus associated nephropathy, and/or other opportunistic infections) \n\n\u2022 Insomnia \n\u2022 Interaction with strong inhibitors and inducers of CY3PA4 \n\u2022 Leukopenia \n\u2022 Lymphoma and other malignancies (including skin cancer) \n\u2022 Male infertility (azospermia and/or oligospermia) \n\u2022 Mucosal inflammation (including oral ulceration and oral mucositis) \n\u2022 Nausea \n\u2022 Neutropenia \n\u2022 Non-infectious pneumonitis \n\u2022 Pain: extremity, incision site and procedural, and back \n\u2022 Proteinuria \n\u2022 Pruritus \n\u2022 Pyrexia \n\u2022 Rash \n\u2022 Stomatitis \n\u2022 Thrombocytopenia \n\u2022 Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)/Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)/ \n\nHemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) \n\u2022 Tremor \n\u2022 Urinary tract infection \n\u2022 Upper respiratory tract infection \n\u2022 Vomiting \n\n \n\n \nLive vaccines should be avoided and close contact with those that have had live vaccines should \nbe avoided. Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. There may be other \npotential adverse events that are unforeseen at this time. \n \n\nExposure to drug and polymer on the XIENCE stent is directly related to the number and lengths \nof the stents implanted. The use of multiple XIENCE stents will result in receiving larger \namounts of drug and polymer. It should be noted that a kidney or heart transplant patient or a \npatient with advanced renal cell carcinoma usually receives a daily dose of the drug everolimus \nby mouth that is several times higher than the maximum dose of the drug contained on one \nXIENCE stent. \n \n\nEverolimus, when given by mouth daily to organ transplant patients or renal cell carcinoma \npatients, may interact with other drugs or substances. Patient should notify the physician about \nany medications they might be taking. \n \n\nThe XIENCE Xpedition stent system is similar to XIENCE PRIME with a new stent delivery \nsystem optimized for acute performance. The XIENCE PRIME and XIENCE Xpedition stent \nsystems are similar to the clinically proven XIENCE V EECSS.  XIENCE PRO (for OUS use \nonly) is just rebranding of XIENCE V EECSS and XIENCE PRIME LL EECSS. The XIENCE \nV EECSS has been shown to be safe and effective in four clinical trials, SPIRIT FIRST, SPIRIT \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 91 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\nII, SPIRIT III and SPIRIT IV.  The SPIRIT PRIME clinical trial is Abbott Vascular\u2019s pivotal US \ntrial evaluating the XIENCE PRIME stent system. The SPRIIT PRIME trial has met all pre- \nspecified performance goals with statistical significance for its primary endpoint of target lesion \nfailure at 1 year. Long-term risks and benefits associated with the XIENCE PRIME stent system \nare currently unknown. \n \n\n15.1.3. Drug Interactions with Everolimus \n \nEverolimus is extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P4503A4 (CYP3A4) in the gut wall \nand liver and is a substrate for the counter transporter P-glycoprotein. Therefore, absorption and \nsubsequent elimination of everolimus may be influenced by drugs that also affect this pathway. \nEverolimus has also been shown to reduce the clearance of some prescription medications when it \nwas administered orally along with cyclosporine (CsA). Formal drug interaction studies have not \nbeen performed with the XIENCE stent because of limited systemic exposure to everolimus eluted \nfrom the XIENCE stent. However, due consideration should be given to the potential for both \nsystemic and local drug interactions in the vessel wall when deciding to place the XIENCE stent \nin a subject taking a drug with known interaction with everolimus. \n\nEverolimus, when prescribed as an oral medication, may interact with the drugs/foods87, 88 listed \nbelow. Medications that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 might reduce everolimus metabolism \nin vivo. Hence, co-administration of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase the blood \nconcentrations of everolimus while co-administration of inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the \nblood concentrations of everolimus. \n \n\n\u2022  CYP3A4 isozyme inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, ritonavir, \nerythromycin, clarithromycin, fluconazole, calcium channel blockers (verapamil and \ndiltiazem), aprepitant atazanavir, nefazodone, amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, \ndelavirdine, fosamprenavir, saquinavir and telithromycin) \n\n\u2022 Inducers of CYP3A4 isozyme (rifampin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, \nphenytoin, dexamethasone) \n\n\u2022 Antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin) \n\u2022 Glucocorticoids \n\u2022 HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (simvastatin, lovastatin) \n\u2022 Digoxin \n\u2022 Cisapride (theoretical potential interaction) \n\u2022 Sildenafil (Viagra\u00ae) (theoretical potential interaction) \n\u2022 Antihistaminics (terfenadine, astemizole) \n\u2022 Grapefruit / grapefruit juice \n\n \n15.1.4. Associated Risks of XIENCE Polymer \n\n \nThe safety and biocompatibility of acrylic and fluoro deposited polymer coatings have been \ndemonstrated based upon XIENCE PRIME stent system biocompatibility testing per ISO 10993- \n1 and the long term use of these polymers in medical implants. These polymers are the same as \nthose of the FDA approved XIENCE V EECS. However, the long-term outcome of the XIENCE \nPRIME/XIENCE Xpedition stent system polymer as a permanent implant is presently unknown. \n \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 92 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n15.1.5. Genotoxicity, Carcinogenicity and Reproductive Toxicity of XIENCE \n \nThe carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity of the XIENCE PRIME and XIENCE \nXpedition stent have not been evaluated; however, long term carcinogenicity and teratology \nstudies were performed with the XIENCE V EECS, a similar everolimus eluting \nsubcutaneously in transgenic mice. Based on the results of this study, the XIENCE V EECS does \nnot appear to be carcinogenic when implanted in transgenic mice for 26 weeks. In the \nreproductive toxicity studies, XIENCE V EECS was implanted in rats and showed no effect on \ntheir fertility or reproductive capability. Additionally, there were no teratogenic effects in the \noffspring in this study89. \n \n\n15.1.5.1. Pregnancy/Fertility \n \nThere are no adequate studies in pregnant women or men intending to father children regarding \nthe safety of everolimus or the XIENCE stent.  Everolimus when administered at oral doses of \n0.1 mg/kg and above showed effects on pre- and post-natal rat development limited to slight \nbody weight changes and fetal survival without any specific toxic potential.87\n\n \n \n\nTherefore, pregnant subjects and those planning pregnancy up to one year following the index \nprocedure are excluded from this study. Women of child bearing age must have a recent negative \npregnancy test prior to randomization. If a female subject does get pregnant, the risks to the fetus \nare unknown. Effective contraception must be used before implanting a XIENCE stent system. \nThe method of contraception is a personal choice but needs to be made with respect to the \nsubject\u2019s  values  with  adequate  medical  information on  the  effectiveness and  safety  of  the \nmethod. Except for surgical removal of the uterus and ovaries or total abstinence, all methods of \nbirth control have a failure rate. Intrauterine devices (IUD), hormonal contraceptives (birth \ncontrol pills, injections or implants), tubal ligation or partner\u2019s vasectomy and barrier \ncontraceptives (condoms, diaphragms, and cervical caps) are available means of birth control. \nThe primary care provider or a gynecologist should be consulted concerning the best birth \ncontrol method for the subject given his/her medical history and lifestyle choices. \n\n \n15.1.5.2. Lactation \n\n \nIt is unknown whether everolimus is distributed in human milk. Everolimus pharmacokinetic and \nsafety profiles have not been determined in infants. Consequently, mothers should be advised of \npotential serious adverse reactions to everolimus in nursing infants. Prior to XIENCE stent \nsystem implantation, a decision should be made regarding whether to discontinue nursing or \nconduct an alternate percutaneous coronary intervention procedure. \n \n\n15.2. Potential Risks \u2013 CABG \n \nThe potential benefits, risks and complications of CABG have been extensively studied and \ndocumented over the last five decades. \n \n\nIn contemporary surgical practice overall hospital mortality for CABG is approximately 2% (1% \nfor elective subjects).  For example in the whole cohort of 113,000 subjects undergoing CABG in \nthe United Kingdom in the four year period 2005 to 2008, including those who were urgent, the \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 93 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\noverall mortality was 1.8% (1.1% in the 78,000 elective subjects).90\n \n\n \n\nComplications of CABG are: \n \n\n \u2022 Death, stroke, shock, prolonged healing of the surgical incision on the chest due to separation \n of the sides of the wound, sternal surgical infection, in-advertent injury to the aorta and/or its \n\nbranches, emergency or non-emergency need for reoperation or angioplasty may occur in < \n2% of the patients. \n\n \u2022 Excessive bleeding, heart attack, kidney failure, a state of subnormal or depressed amount of \n blood being pumped by the heart (low cardiac output syndrome) requiring intravenous \n medicine support and/or mechanical assistance from an intra-aortic balloon pump, \n development of blood clots, abnormal blood pressure, fluid development in the lungs \n (pulmonary edema), may occur in 2% to 5% of the patients. \n\n \u2022 Chest pain, respiratory failure, need for mechanical support for breathing, rapid or slow heart \n beat, post-op impaired neurocongnitive functioning, fever, nausea may occur in 5-10% of the \n patients. \n\n \nThe rates of surgical and procedural risks for patients being treated for LM disease or Left Main \nEquivalent disease may be higher than the experience worldwide with cardiac catheterization and \ninterventional procedures. \n \n\n15.3. Major Adverse Event Rates in Left Main Studies \n \nLong term adverse event data for PCI in the LM population has not been extensively studied or \nreported and is therefore not provided in the risk analysis section. Recent literature on major \ncardiac event rates in left main procedures1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 is limited and emerging. In trials conducted \nin patients with LM disease treated with either PCI or CABG, the following range of major \nadverse event rates were observed: death (2.0% at one year to 11.2% at 5 years), myocardial \ninfarction (1.0% at one year to 15.7% at 5 years), stroke (0.1% at one year to 5.9% at 5 years) and  \nrevascularization (3.4% at one year to 19.7% at 5 years). \n \n\n15.4. Gender/ Race Specific Prevalence \n \nCoronary artery disease (CAD) continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality \namong women in the United States and throughout the world.91,92   The prevalence of coronary \nartery disease in United States is estimated at 17.6 million for both sexes of which 8.5 million are  \n \nreported to be in females.93   The age-adjusted death rate resulting from coronary artery disease \n(CAD) in females, which accounts for about half of all cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths in \nwomen, was 95.7 per 100, 000 females in 2007 which was a third of what was observed in \n1980.94, 95   Despite a decline in the overall cardiovascular deaths in females, recently CAD rates \nin US women 35 to 54 years age appear to be increasing, likely associated with obesity.96\n\n \n \n\nLimited race specific data available has shown African-American women to have higher coronary \nheart disease mortality risk in comparison to white women since the 1940s97 attributed mainly to \nsubstantially lower rate of awareness of heart disease and stroke that has been documented among \nblack versus white women. 98 , 99 In contrast, Hispanics have the lowest percentage of \ncardiovascular deaths (21.7%) compared with non-Hispanics (26.3%) despite their lower \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 94 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\nsocioeconomic status, and inadequate access to healthcare in United States (known as \n\u2018Hispanic Paradox\u2019).100, 101, 102\n\n \n \n\n1 Serruys, P.

Literature for Left Main (LM) disease with respect to gender \nshows a lower prevalence in women than men particularly in the definite angina group.  In the \nCASS study, it was observed that in men 50 years or older, 50% had three-vessel or left main \ndisease whereas in women left main disease or three-vessel disease occurred in over 40% of \nwomen older than 60 years of age.103\n\n \n \n\n15.4.1. Gender-specific and Race-specific Diagnosis and Treatment Patterns \n \nIt is well documented in literature that men and women present with CAD differently in terms of \nepidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical  presentation, diagnosis and  management. 104 , 105 , 106 ,\n\n \n107,108, 109 \n \nIn general, women are less likely to be referred for functional testing of ischemia and that a \nlower rate of diagnostic angiograms and interventional procedures are performed compared with \nmen.110  A study that used referral to cardiac catheterization as an indication of perceived patient \nrisk observed that approximately 42% women underwent cardiac catheterization compared to \napproximately 50% men.111\n\n \n \n\nAlthough men and women share most classic risk factors, the significance and the relative \nweighting of these factors are different for the two genders.  In women, menopause is associated \nwith a worsening of CAD risk profile.112  The clinical presentation of CAD and the interpretation \nof noninvasive diagnostic testing is less reliable in women (atypical symptoms) compared with \nmen, especially in the age group below 55 years when the prevalence of coronary artery disease is \nstill relatively low.113  Thus, women in this age group are significantly less likely than men to \nhave ECGs suggestive of myocardial ischemia.114  Additionally, women presenting with chest \npain are less likely to undergo diagnostic testing and are less likely to have a positive exercise \ntest or imaging study.115  In general, women usually experience a delay in the clinical diagnosis, \nwhich may easily translate into increased procedural morbidity and mortality.  Additionally, \ndisparities have been found in the administration and performance of both noninvasive testing \n\nand cardiac catheterization.

Clinically Significant Gender Differences in Outcomes Related to \n Safety or Effectiveness \n\n \nThe recognition of gender disparities in the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of \ncardiovascular disease are well-established.  However, there is limited literature regarding the \ninfluence of gender on treatment patterns and outcomes of coronary revascularization.  Due to a \nhigher baseline risk profile and more complex angiographic characteristics, women tend to have \nworse clinical outcomes compared to men.123, 124, 125\n\n \n \n\nSeveral studies indicate that women are less likely than men to undergo diagnostic \ncatheterization.126,127, 128  However, in recent drug eluting trials as discussed below, it is indicated \nthat women who underwent stent based PCI procedures or CABG procedures irrespective of the \ntype of DES including the left main disease, had similar clinical outcomes as observed in men. \n \n\nDespite less favorable baseline clinical and angiographic features in women compared with men, \nthe angiographic and clinical benefits are independent of gender using different drug eluting  \nstents.116,117,129, 130, 131   Similar observations have been reported for men and women undergoing  \nby-pass surgery after accounting for differences in the risk variables.119,120,121    Of particular \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 97 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\ninterest is the observation by the Investigators of SYNTAX trial where despite gender related \ndifferences in baseline co-morbidities, the outcomes between CABG and PCI at 12 months were \nsimilar for men and women in the most challenging group of patients with three vessel and/or \nleft main disease.122\n\n \n \n \n\n15.5. Risk Management Procedures \n \nSubjects will be monitored closely throughout the trial duration. Subjects will be evaluated \nclinically at pre-determined timepoints to assess their clinical status. \n \n\nAn independent DSMB will monitor safety of the subjects throughout the trial. \n \n\n15.5.1. Post PCI \n \nAs part of the dual antiplatelet strategy, aspirin \u226575 mg per day indefinitely is mandatory post \nprocedure.  Additionally chronic daily ADP antagonist therapy is mandated following PCI with \nchoices including either: \n \n\n\u2022 clopidogrel 75 mg per day, or 150 mg per day for 7-30 days then reduced to 75 mg per day, \nunless subject is hyporesponsive to clopidogrel, or \n\n\u2022   prasugrel 5 or 10 mg per day, or \n\u2022 ticagrelor per labeling and recommended guidelines if approved by the local regulatory \n\nauthorities during the treatment period of this protocol. \n \n\nIn subjects who received a ULMCA DES, a daily ADP antagonist must be given for at least one \nyear, and is recommended for the duration of the trial in the absence of major bleeding \ncomplications or other major complications. ADP antagonists must not be discontinued within \nthe first year after DES implantation unless absolutely necessary for major bleeding \ncomplications, major trauma, major surgery necessitating discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy \n(e.g. intracranial surgery), etc.  If an ADP antagonist must be discontinued, a GP IIb/IIIa bridging \nstrategy up until the time of surgery may be considered, followed by re-loading of the ADP \nantagonist as soon as possible post surgery. \n \n\n15.5.2. Post CABG \n \nAspirin must be used daily for the duration of the trial.  Subjects who are treated with CABG \nshould receive the following medications as per the local institution standard of care unless \nmedically contraindicated: beta blocker and statins.  If there is left ventricular dysfunction, an \nACE inhibitor should also be prescribed. \n \n\nSection 22 outlines the recommended care of post-CABG subjects. \n \n\n15.5.3. Gender-specific \n \nAbbott Vascular plans to encourage investigators participating in this trial to randomize women  \nthat meet inclusion/exclusion criteria of this study.

This exclusion is because the \neffects of the XIENCE Drug Eluting Stents have not been studied in pregnant females in the past \nand any potential iatrogenic effects of the drug/device on the pregnant female and the fetus \nremain unknown. \n \n\nIn an effort to better understand any potential gender differences from this trial, the gender \nsubgroup has been prespecified in the EXCEL protocol (Section 9.1 Gender-specific subgroup \nanalysis, Section 17.5 QoL subgroup analyses and Section 21.2 Pre-specified subgroups). These \nanalyses will be descriptive and hypothesis generating and may provide further insights in \nunderstanding any potential gender differences. \n \n\nAbbott Vascular believes that the proportion of women randomized in the EXCEL clinical trial \nwill reflect the proportion of women reaching the catheterization laboratory.  Moreover, the data \nobtained from the prespecified gender subgroup analysis in the EXCEL trial will provide robust \ndescriptive data in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and clinical outcomes in men and women. \n \n\n15.6.

The XIENCE V EECSS has been evaluated in the SPIRIT FIRST, SPIRIT \nII, SPIRIT III and SPIRIT IV trials and demonstrated safety and efficacy. \n \n\nAdditionally, the SPIRIT PRIME study, a prospective, two-arm, open-label, multi-center registry \nusing the XIENCE PRIME Stent system (XIENCE PRIME and XIENCE PRIME LL EECSS) in \n500 subjects is being conducted at up to 75 global sites. Overall, the long-term effects and \npotential benefits of XIENCE PRIME stent system are not yet known. \n \n\nDrug eluting stents have been associated with a reduction in the need for repeat revascularization \nwithout an increase in the risk of death or myocardial infarction for subjects with ULMCA \nstenosis compared to bare metal stent.89  In another study by Tamburino et al, in a large population \nof subjects with acute coronary syndrome and ULMCA disease, DES were more effective than \nBMS in reducing myocardial infarction and target lesion revascularization.132 The LEMANS \nRegistry has shown good long term outcome with implantation of DES for ULMCA coronary \nartery disease. DES stenting of ULMCA decreased the risk of long-term MACCE with improved \nsurvival in subjects with distal ULMCA disease.133 The ISAR-Left Main randomized clinical trial \nhas shown that implantation with either paclitaxel or sirolimus eluting stents in ULMCA lesions \nis safe and effective with comparable clinical and angiographic outcomes. Additionally, for both \nstent types, definite stent thrombosis rates at two years were low and comparable with no new \nevents beyond 30 days post index procedure.23\n\n \n \n\nThese studies not only demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of drug eluting stents in the \ntreatment of ULMCA disease but also indicate the absence of signal suggesting an increased  \nsafety risk with DES stenting of the ULMCA.25, 134\n\n \n \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 99 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n15.6.2.

APPENDIX A: DEFINITIONS, ABBREVIATIONS, AND ACRONYMS \n \n\n16.1. Primary and Major Secondary Endpoint Definitions \n \n\n16.1.1. Definition of Death \n \nThe cause of death will be adjudicated as being due to cardiovascular causes, non cardiovascular \ncauses, or undetermined causes. \n\u2022 Cardiovascular Death includes sudden cardiac death, death due to acute myocardial \n\ninfarction, death due to heart failure or cardiogenic shock, death due to stroke, death due to \nother cardiovascular causes, and death due to bleeding as follows: \n\n \u25e6  Sudden Cardiac Death refers to death that occurs unexpectedly and includes the  \n following deaths: \n\uf0a7    Witnessed and instantaneous without new or worsening symptoms \n\uf0a7    Witnessed within 60 minutes of the onset of new or worsening cardiac symptoms \n\uf0a7 Witnessed and attributed to an identified arrhythmia (e.g., captured on an \n\nelectrocardiographic (ECG) recording or witnessed on a monitor by either a medic or \nparamedic) \n\n\uf0a7    Subjects unsuccessfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest \n\uf0a7 Subjects successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest but who die without identification \n\nof a non-cardiac etiology (Post-Cardiac Arrest Syndrome) \n\uf0a7 Unwitnessed death or other causes of death (information regarding the subject\u2019s \n\nclinical status preceding death should be provided, if available) \n \u25e6 Death due to Acute Myocardial Infarction refers to an acute myocardial infarction \n\n (MI) leading inexorably to death, generally within 30 days.  Death due to known sequelae \n of MI including mechanical complications, arrhythmia, and/or pump failure, as well as \n death resulting from a procedure to treat myocardial ischemia or to treat a complication \n resulting from myocardial infarction should be considered death due to acute MI.  The \n acute myocardial infarction should be verified either by the diagnostic criteria outlined \n for acute myocardial infarction or by autopsy findings showing recent myocardial \n infarction or recent coronary thrombus, and there should be no conclusive evidence of \n another cause of death. \n\n \n\nIf death occurs before biochemical confirmation of myocardial necrosis can be obtained, \nadjudication should be based on clinical presentation and ECG evidence. \n \n\nDeath due to a myocardial infarction that occurs as a direct consequence of a \ncardiovascular investigation, procedure, or operation should be classified as death due to \nother cardiovascular cause. \n\n \u25e6 Death due to Heart Failure or Cardiogenic Shock refers to death occurring in the \n context of clinically worsening symptoms and/or signs of heart failure without evidence \n of another cause of death. \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 101 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDeath due to heart failure or cardiogenic shock should include sudden death occurring \nduring an admission for worsening heart failure as well as death from progressive heart \nfailure or cardiogenic shock following implantation of a mechanical assist device. \n\n \n\nNew or worsening signs and/or symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) include any \nof the following: \n\uf0a7 New or increasing symptoms and/or signs of heart failure requiring the initiation of, \n\nor an increase in, treatment directed at heart failure or occurring in a subject already \nreceiving maximal therapy for heart failure \n\n\uf0a7 Heart failure symptoms or signs requiring continuous intravenous therapy or chronic \noxygen administration for hypoxia due to pulmonary edema \n\n\uf0a7    Confinement to bed predominantly due to heart failure symptoms \n\uf0a7 Pulmonary edema sufficient to cause tachypnea and distress not occurring in the \n\ncontext of an acute myocardial infarction, worsening renal function, or as the \nconsequence of an arrhythmia occurring in the absence of worsening heart failure \n\n\uf0a7 Cardiogenic shock not occurring in the context of an acute myocardial infarction or as \nthe consequence of an arrhythmia occurring in the absence of worsening heart failure. \nCardiogenic shock is defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mm Hg for greater \nthan 1 hour, not responsive to fluid resuscitation and/or heart rate correction, and felt \nto  be  secondary to  cardiac  dysfunction and  associated with  at  least  one  of  the \nfollowing signs of hypoperfusion: \n\u2022    Cool, clammy skin or \n\u2022    Oliguria (urine output < 30 mL/hour) or \n\u2022    Altered sensorium or \n\u2022    Cardiac index < 2.2 L/min/m2\n\n \n \n\nCardiogenic shock can also be defined if SBP < 90 mm Hg and increases to \u2265 90 mm \nHg in less than 1 hour with positive inotropic or vasopressor agents alone and/or with \nmechanical support. \n\n \n\nNote: Heart failure may have a number of underlying causes, including acute or \nchronic ischemia, structural heart disease (e.g. hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), and \nvalvular heart disease.  Where treatments are likely to have specific effects, and it is \nlikely possible to distinguish between the various causes, then it may be reasonable to \nseparate out the relevant treatment effects.  In other cases, the aggregation implied by \nthe definition above may be more appropriate. \n\n\u25e6 Death due to Stroke (Cerebrovascular Event:  intracranial hemorrhage or non- \nhemorrhagic stroke) refers to a cerebrovascular event or a complication of a \ncerebrovascular event that leads inexorably to death, generally within 30 days after the \nsuspected event.  These deaths may be based on clinical signs and symptoms as well as \nneuroimaging and/or autopsy.  There should be no conclusive evidence of another cause \nof death. \n\n\u25e6 Death due to Other Cardiovascular Causes refers to death due to a cardiovascular \ncause not included in the above categories (e.g. dysrhythmia, pulmonary embolism,  \n\n  \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 102 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n cardiovascular  intervention,  aortic  aneurysm  rupture,  or  peripheral  arterial  disease). \n\nMortal complications of cardiac surgery or PCI, even if \u201cnon-cardiovascular\u201d in nature, \nshould be classified as cardiovascular deaths. \n\n\u25e6 Death Due to Bleeding refers to fatal bleeding or bleeding which contributes to death, \nwith categories being mutually exclusive. \n\uf0a7 Fatal Bleeding: death in which a bleeding event directly leads to death within 7 days. \n\nExamples of fatal bleeding include an intracranial hemorrhage that leads to herniation \nof the brain and death within 24 hours, or a massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage that \nresults in shock, hemodynamic collapse, and death.  If a bleeding event is considered \nfatal, then the cause of death should be either intracranial or non-intracranial bleeding. \n\n\uf0a7 Bleeding Contributes to Death:  death in which a bleeding event is part of a causal \nchain of medical events that ultimately leads to death within 30 days of the bleed, but \nbleeding  is  not  directly  and/or  immediately related  to  the  subject\u2019s  death.    An \nexample of bleeding that contributes to death is a large retroperitoneal bleed that \nleads to surgical evacuation and subsequent development of an abscess in the area of \nbleeding that leads to sepsis, multiorgan failure, and death 10 days after the onset of \nbleeding. If bleeding contributes to death (but the bleeding is not categorized as \n\u201cfatal\u201d), then the cause of death should be recorded as something other than \nintracranial/non-intracranial bleeding. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Non-Cardiovascular Death is defined as any death not covered by cardiac death or vascular \ndeath. Categories include but are not limited to: \n\u25e6 Pulmonary causes \n\u25e6 Renal causes \n\u25e6 Gastrointestinal causes \n\u25e6 Infection (includes sepsis) \n\u25e6 Non-infectious (e.g., systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)) \n\u25e6 Malignancy (i.e., new malignancy, worsening of prior malignancy) \n\u25e6 Accidental/Trauma \n\u25e6 Suicide \n\u25e6 Non-cardiovascular system organ failure (e.g., hepatic failure) \n\u25e6 Non-cardiovascular surgery \n\u25e6 Other non-cardiovascular \n\n \n\n\u2022 Undetermined cause of death refers to a death not attributable to one of the above \ncategories of cardiovascular death or to a non-cardiovascular cause.

In this regard, \nsmall levels of cardiac enzyme elevation after PCI reflect the underlying degree of \natherosclerosis 135 and seem to have little or no prognostic significance, 136 , 137 Large-scale \nstudies in the stent era have shown that peak post-PCI levels of \u22658x the upper limits of \nnormal ULN or \u226510x ULN are required before an association with subsequent mortality \nemerges,138 although some studies have suggested that a CPK-MB of CPK-MB \u22655x ULN \nmay be prognostically important.137,139, 140 Myocardial infarction may be difficult to diagnosis \nin the peri-surgical period given an obligate release of cardiac enzymes from all CABG \nprocedures, although post CABG CPK-MB levels of \u22655 fold or \u226510 fold increased have been \nshown to be prognostically related to subsequent mortality. 141 , 142 , 143 , 144 Moreover, cardiac \ntroponin elevations after PCI are of uncertain prognostic importance, in contrast to  \n \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 104 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\nspontaneous troponin elevations in subjects with myonecrosis unrelated to revascularization \nprocedures (spontaneous MI), for which numerous studies have shown to be strongly \npredictive of subsequent mortality.140, 145,146, 147, 148, 149, 150 Thus, in the present study only CK-\nMB elevations will be used for determination of peri-procedural MI, whereas troponin or \nCK-MB elevations may be used to diagnose spontaneous MI. \n\n \n\nCK-MB levels will be drawn at baseline and at 12\u00b12 hrs and at 24\u00b12 hrs post procedure (or \nat discharge if this occurs before 24\u00b12 hrs), and more frequently for signs or cardiac \nsymptoms of clinical or hemodynamic instability.  12-lead EKGs will be recorded at baseline, \nwithin 24 hours after the procedure (at the same time as the CK-MB draw if possible) and at \ndischarge. \n\n \n\nThe baseline CK-MB must be normal for subject enrolment in this study.

APPENDIX B: QUALITY OF LIFE AND U.S. HEALTH ECONOMICS \n\nSUB-STUDIES \n \nAs described in the main clinical protocol, the EXCEL trial will randomize approximately 1900 \nselected subjects with unprotected left main disease to the XIENCE DES vs. CABG and follow \nthem for up to 10 years; the primary endpoint of the trial is death, MI, or stroke at a median \nfollow-up of 3-years. Given the large sample size and extended follow-up duration, EXCEL will \nprovide an ideal setting in which to definitively examine the relative costs, quality of life \nbenefits, and cost-effectiveness of PCI for this important subject population. In this proposal, the \nspecific goals of the proposed health economic and quality of life studies are outlined as well as \nthe general analytic plans. \n \n\nThe proposed analyses will be directed in about 1800 subjects by David J. Cohen, M.D., M.Sc. \nin conjunction with the Health Economics and Technology Assessment (HETA) Group of Saint \nLuke\u2019s Mid America Heart Institute.  Of note, since cost-effectiveness is dependent on the \nperspective of the analysis, the health economic analyses described in this proposal will be \nperformed specifically from the U.S. perspective. If additional perspectives from other countries \nare desired, it should be possible to collaborate with local health economists to extend these \nmethods to these additional countries. \n \n\n17.1. Study Objectives \n \n\n17.1.1. Cost Studies \n \n\n\u2022 To compare long-term medical care costs for subjects with unprotected left main \ncoronary disease treated with either PCI (using the XIENCE drug-eluting stent) or CABG \nfrom the perspective of the U.S. healthcare system \n\n \n\n\u2022 To identify factors in addition to treatment assignment that are associated with variations \nin long-term medical care costs in subjects undergoing revascularization for unprotected \nleft main coronary disease. \n\n \n17.1.2. Quality of Life Studies \n\n \n\u2022 To compare health-related quality of life between alternative strategies of percutaneous \n\nor surgical coronary revascularization, according to the design of the EXCEL trial. \n \n\n\u2022 To identify factors, in addition to treatment assignment, those are associated with \nvariations in quality of life for subjects with left main coronary disease. \n\n \n17.1.3. Cost-effectiveness Studies \n \n\n\u2022 Within the context of the EXCEL trial, to evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of PCI \nwith drug-eluting stents and CABG, measured as cost per quality-adjusted year of life \ngained, over a 3 to 5-year time horizon. \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 119 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 To evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of PCI with drug-eluting stents vs. CABG in terms \nof additional endpoints including cost per life-year gained, cost per death, MI, or stroke avoided, \nand cost per repeat revascularization procedure avoided. \n \n\n17.2. Subject Population \n \nThe population for the quality of life and cost-effectiveness sub-studies will consist of 1800 \nsubjects.  The primary analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis.  In \nparticular, any subjects who die prior to receiving their initial revascularization procedure will be \nretained in the ITT analyses and considered as part of their randomization group.  Secondary \nanalyses will be performed based on the per-protocol population (i.e., sub-study subjects who \nreceive their assigned treatment) and a treatment-received population (sub-study subjects based on \nthe initial revascularization procedure performed). \n \n\n17.3. Quality of Life Assessment \n \nHealth-related quality of life will be measured using an instrument incorporating both disease- \nspecific and generic health status measures appropriate for the assessment of subjects with \ncoronary artery disease.  Each of the individual health status measures described below has been \nselecting from an existing instrument that has undergone extensive reliability and validity testing \nand is appropriate for the subject population being studied in the EXCEL trial. \n \n\n17.3.1. Disease-specific measures \n \nThe goal of the disease-specific measures is to detect differences in health-related quality of life \nrelated directly to the two revascularization strategies under consideration.  Thus, the primary \nfocus of the disease-specific measures will be to detect differences in symptoms or in quality of \nlife directly attributable to coronary artery disease and its principal complications. \n \n\nCardiovascular-specific quality of life will be measured using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire \n(SAQ)77 along with the London School of Hygiene Dyspnea Questionnaire.79    The SAQ is a 19-\nitem questionnaire that measures five domains of CAD-related health status: angina frequency, \nphysical limitations, disease perception/QoL, angina stability, and treatment satisfaction.  Scores \nrange from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating fewer symptoms and thus better health status.  \nThe SAQ has undergone extensive reliability and validity testing77, 78and has been shown to \ncorrelate with long-term survival and ACS hospitalization among subjects with chronic \nCAD.152The London School of Hygiene Dyspnea Questionnaire was originally adapted from the \nRose Angina Questionnaire and assesses the individual\u2019s level of dyspnea with common \nactivities.79   Previous research has demonstrated that this scale measures an important component \nof HRQoL in subjects with chronic coronary disease that is independent of traditional angina \nscales.80   In addition to their established validity and reliability in subjects with coronary artery \ndisease, these instruments are easily administered either by written questionnaire or direct \ninterview. \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 120 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n17.3.2. Generic quality of life measures \n \nThe principal generic quality of life measure for this study will be the Medical Outcomes Study \n12-item Short Form Health Status questionnaire (SF-12).82The SF-12 is derived from the larger \nMedical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36), a 36 item questionnaire that has undergone \nextensive consistency, reliability, and validity testing and has been used to assess quality of life \noutcomes in more than 250 clinical trials.153, 154 The SF-12 produces two summary scales that \nassess both physical and mental/emotional health; these summary scores  have been shown to \ncorrelate well with those obtained from the longer, more time consuming SF-36.82   In addition to \nlimiting subject burden, a specific advantage of the SF-12 for the purposes of this study is that \nthe summary scales are scored such that the U.S. population mean is 50 and the population \nstandard deviation is 10, thus providing highly interpretable data relative to other populations \nand health states. \n\n \n17.3.3. Mental Health/Depression \n\n \nIn both anecdotal experience and uncontrolled observations, depression has been reported to be a \nrelatively common and debilitating late-term complication of CABG.  Therefore, in addition to \nthe mental health index provided by the SF-12, a more detailed assessment of depression using \nthe PHQ-8 will be performed. This 8-item module derived from the larger Patient Health \nQuestionnaire has been shown to be a highly valid and reliable measure of depression.  Scores \nrange from 0 to 24 with levels \u22655 generally considered to represent mild depression and levels \n\u226510 representing moderate depression. 155  It differs from the original PHQ-9 only in the \nelimination of the suicidality question, which may be considered to be inappropriate for many \nclinical trial population.81  Similar to the SAQ and SF-12, culturally valid translations are \navailable in multiple languages including virtually all of the countries that are expected to \ncontribute subjects to the EXCEL trial. \n\n \n17.3.4. Utility measurement \n\n \nFor the purposes of cost-effectiveness analysis, quality of life must also be measured in terms of \n\u201cutility\u201d, a global rating (on a 0-1 scale) that reflects an individual\u2019s preference for his or her \ncurrent health state relative to perfect health.29   Although in the past, it had been customary to \nmeasure utility directly from trial participants using time-tradeoff techniques,156, 157 there is an \nemerging consensus that cost-effectiveness analyses designed to inform societal resource \nallocation use community-based (rather than subject-based) preferences.158\n\n \n \n\nThere are a number of potential techniques for measurement of subject-specific, population- \nbased utility weights within the EXCEL trial.  These include the Health Utilities Index (HUI),159 \n\nthe Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB), 160 the EuroQol (EQ-5D),83  and recently published \nalgorithms that allow mapping of the SF-36 or SF-12 to health state utilities.161, 162   Although \neach of these approaches has intrinsic advantages (and disadvantages), the preferred utility \ninstrument for the EXCEL trial is the EQ-5D.  The EQ-5D is a multiattribute health status \nclassification system with an empirically-derived preference based scoring system based on \nanalysis of time trade-off utilities for selected health states among 2997 randomly-selected \nmembers of the adult population of the U.K. 163 Recently, analogous preference-weights have \nbeen developed for U.S. population utilities.84\n\n \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 121 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAlthough the EQ-5D was not specifically developed for use in subjects with coronary artery \ndisease, it offers several specific advantages for this trial.  First, it is based on a health state \nclassification system that includes five specific domains of health: mobility, self-care, usual \nactivities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.  By incorporating many of the domains that \nare likely to be affected by coronary artery disease and its complications, such as pain, physical \nlimitations, and role limitations, the EQ-5D should capture important differences in health within \nthe study population.  Second, the EQ-5D may be administered by either a five item written \nquestionnaire or telephone interview and thus should add little burden to the overall data \ncollection task.  By comparison, both the HUI and the QWB questionnaires are substantially \nlonger and, in previous experience, are often too burdensome for chronically-ill subjects. Finally, \nconsiderable practical experience with the EQ-5D exists as it has been used successfully as the \nprincipal utility measure in the Benestent II Trial (n=823)164 and the PAMI Stent trial \n(n=900),165 and most recently in the SYNTAX trial. \n \n\n17.3.5. Economic Data Collection \n \nThe following data elements will be obtained from the EXCEL trial database for use in this sub- \nstudy: \n \n\n\u2022 Measures of global medical resource utilization for each hospitalization including length of \nstay and number of ICU days. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Cardiac catheterization laboratory resource utilization for the index procedure as well as any \nsubsequent catheterizations or PCI procedures required during the follow-up period. Data \ncollected will include total procedure duration; numbers of angioplasty balloons, stents \n(bare and drug-eluting), guidewires, ultrasound catheters, and guiding catheters used; \nadjunctive medications used including glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists and direct thrombin \ninhibitors; and the amount and type of contrast dye required.  These data will provide a \ndirect measure of resource utilization for the two strategies, and will be used to examine the \ntrue costs of initial PCI based on standard, \u201cbottom-up\u201d accounting measures.85,166 \n\n \n\n\u2022 Measures of global resource utilization for each initial and follow-up hospitalization for \ntreatment of cardiovascular disease, its direct complications, and potential complications of \ntreatment.  For each hospital admission, these data will include total length of stay, number \nof ICU days, principal diagnosis, and major procedures performed during the \nhospitalization (e.g., coronary revascularization, pacemaker or ICD implantation, \nperipheralvascular   surgery).  Hospital admissions unrelated to treatment of cardiovascular \ndisease or potential complications of its treatment will be identified by an independent review \ncommittee, blinded to initial treatment assignment and excluded from the economic analysis, \nsince any differences in these events are unlikely to be related to the assigned treatment \nstrategy.  Thus, their inclusion in the economic analysis would only increase the variance of \nthe cost estimates and reduce statistical power. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Detailed listing of outpatient medications for treatment of cardiovascular disease at each \nfollow-up subject contact. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Subject estimates (by  self-report) of  utilization of  outpatient cardiovascular services \nincluding diagnostic testing (e.g., ETT, nuclear stress testing, echocardiography, cardiac \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 122 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\nCT); outpatient procedures (e.g., diagnostic catheterization, cardioversion); and physician \nvisits. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Number and duration of admissions to rehabilitation hospitals, nursing homes, and other \nchronic care facilities. \n\n \n17.4. Cost Measurement \n\n \n17.4.1. Procedural Costs \n\n \nCatheterization laboratory and bypass costs will be calculated for each subject using standard, \n\u201cbottom-up\u201d cost accounting methods using the most current unit costs available at the time of \neach analysis.85   For example, if the 1-year analysis is performed in 2013, every effort will be \nmade to obtain updated unit costs for 2013.  Similarly, if the 5-year analysis is performed in \n2015, unit costs for that year will be used as the basis for the cost analysis.  The rationale for \nusing updated costs is that the goal of the cost-effectiveness analysis is to inform ongoing policy \ndevelopment and not merely to describe historically-relevant costs. \n \n\nFor major disposable items (including angioplasty balloons, bare metal and drug-eluting stents, \nguidewires, and guiding catheters), costs will be based on a survey of U.S. hospital and \ncatheterization laboratory administrators as to the acquisition costs for the item at the time of the \nanalysis.  Drug costs for procedural anticoagulants including glycoprotein 2b/3a antagonists, \ndirect thrombin inhibitors, and thrombolytic agents will be determined in a similar fashion. \nUpdated cost data for the final calculations and analysis will ensure that the cost estimates are \naccurate at the time of publication.  The cost of other disposables, depreciation, and overhead for \ncatheterization laboratory maintenance, and non-physician personnel will be estimated based on \nthe average cost per procedure at 3-5 geographically diverse U.S. medical centers during the \nsame time frame and adjusted for measured procedure duration.  Similar methods will be applied to \nestimate the procedural cost of CABG. \n \n\n17.4.2. Non-procedural Hospitalization Costs \n \nThe non-procedural costs of hospitalizations will be estimated in two ways.  The primary method \nwill utilize an event-based approach to estimating costs; the secondary approach will utilize a \nresource-based approach.  The advantage of the event-based approach to hospitalization costs is \nthat it does not rely on an assumption of comparability of length of stay between U.S. and non- \nU.S. subjects.  Rather, nationally-representative data will be used to estimate the cost of an \nuncomplicated hospital admission and also the relationship between specific procedural \ncomplications and hospital costs.  This approach is identical to one that has recently been \nemployed for calculation of costs in the SYNTAX trial.  Details of this estimation process are \noutlined below. \n \n\nThe event-based approach relies on the Medicare Provider and Review (MedPAR) database. \nThe MedPAR file is an administrative database maintained by the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services containing all claims submitted by hospitals for services provided to Medicare \nbeneficiaries.  For each hospitalization, the MedPAR record includes information on age, sex, \nrace, date of admission, date of discharge; the principal diagnosis code (ICD-9-CM), eight \n\nsecondary ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes, six ICD-9-CM procedure codes, discharge status, total \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 123 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\ncharges, total reimbursement, and the hospital\u2019s Medicare provider number. \n \n\nEstimating costs consists of three steps.  In the first step, the MedPAR database will be used to \nmodel the relationship between the total index hospitalization costs and the costs associated with \nvarious complications occurring after the procedure of interest but during the index \nhospitalization.  Estimates of the costs of these complications will be obtained via a regression \nusing a model with structure: \n \n\nTC i  = A + X i \u03b2 + Zi \u03b4 + u i \n \n\nwhere TCi  is the total cost of the index hospitalization for subject i, Xi  is a set of indicator \nvariables for subject i denoting whether particular complications occurred, \u03b2 is an associated \nparameter vector representing the estimated costs of the complications, Zi is a set of individual \nbaseline subject characteristics (e.g., age, sex, etc.), \u03b4 is an associated parameter vector \nrepresenting the incremental cost of the characteristics, A represents the sum of procedural costs \nand any other costs for an uncomplicated hospitalization, and ui is a residual.  This model will be \nestimated separately for each procedure type. \n \n\nThe second step will be to obtain an estimate of the mean cost of uncomplicated hospitalizations. \nLetting UHC be uncomplicated hospitalization costs (excluding procedural costs), and PC be \nprocedural costs, for each subject is defined as: \n \n\n      Wi = UHCi + PCi, \n \n\nwhich would imply \n \n\n \nW = UHC + PC. \n\n \n\nSince the regression in step 1 does not specify a separate intercept for each subject, it is \nreasonable to think of A as an average across all subjects, i.e., that \u00c2 is an estimate of  W .  Then a \nstraightforward way to estimate mean uncomplicated hospital costs (UHC ) is to subtract an \nestimate of mean procedure costs ( PC ) from the estimate of A, i.e., \n \n\n      ^   \n \n^     \u0302    \n\n      UHC = A\u2212 PC \n \n\nMean procedure costs for use in this step will be obtained from the REPLACE-2 trial (14) or a \ncomparable multicenter registry or trial that reflects contemporary PCI practice in a broad, \nrelatively unselected subject population. \n \n\nThe third step is to combine the previously obtained parameter values to produce an estimate of \nU.S.-relevant costs based on the data from the EXCEL trial. First, an estimate of subject-specific \nvariable costs (Qi) will be obtained by the estimates of \u03b2 and \u03b4 (as previously derived from the \nMedPAR analyses) to the EXCEL subject data, i.e., \n \n\n^ ^ ^\n  \n\nQi  = X i \u03b2+ Zi \u03b4 , \n                 ^                ^ \n\nwhere \u03b2 and \u03b4 are the estimates of \u03b2 and \u03b4, respectively.  An estimate of non-procedural costs \n          \n\n \n\n         ^ \n( NPC i ) is then obtained for each subject i by adding subject specific variable costs to the \naverage cost of an uncomplicated subject \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 124 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n^       ^       ^ \n\nNPCi  = UHC+ Qi . \n \n\nWe will then calculate total hospital cost by adding the resource-based procedure costs to the \nestimated non-procedural costs, i.e. \n\n \n^ ^ ^ \n\nTC i  = NPC i + PC i  . \n \n\nFinally, in order to preserve subject variability in the cost data, residuals drawn from the step (1) \nregression will be added to the expected values.  The approach outlined above will be used to \ncalculate the cost of each index hospitalization as well as any subsequent hospitalizations during \nwhich a coronary revascularization procedure is performed. \n\n \nFor all other cardiovascular hospitalizations, data on principal and secondary diagnoses and any \nmajor procedures performed will be used to assign a DRG to the hospitalization.  This mapping \nprocedure will be performed in a blinded fashion by the MAHI HETA group working in \nconjunction with a trained Medicare coder.  For each subsequent hospitalization, costs will be \nassigned based on the average cost for the relevant DRG based on MedPAR data.   As noted \npreviously, prior to performing the economic analysis, all rehospitalizations will be reviewed by \nan independent review committee (blinded to treatment group) to determine those \nhospitalizations that are unrelated to cardiovascular disease or its direct complications that will \nbe excluded from the analysis. \n\n \nAs a sensitivity analysis, a more direct, resource-based approach to estimating non-procedural \nhospital costs will be considered.  For this approach, either the MEDPAR database or a large, \nsingle-center database (e.g., Mid America Heart Institute) will be used to develop a regression \nmodel for non-procedural hospital costs based on subject characteristics, length of stay (LOS) \nelements (ICU, non-ICU), as well as specific procedures and in-hospital complications.   The \nregression coefficients from the associated models will then be used to estimate non-procedural \nhospitalization  costs  based  on  the  observed  resource  utilization  data  from  the  EXCEL \npopulation.   All other costs (e.g., procedural costs, cardiovascular hospitalizations without \nrevascularization procedures) will be calculated in the identical fashion to the \u201cevent-based\u201d \napproach described previously. \n\n \n17.4.3. Other costs \n\n \nFor all hospitalizations associated with coronary revascularization procedures, physician costs \nwill be estimated on the basis of standard procedural codes and the Medicare Fee Schedule.  For \nall other hospitalizations, physician costs will be estimated as a percentage of hospital costs \naccording to DRG and corresponding Medicare physician cost to hospital cost ratio.167, 168   Costs \nfor outpatient medical care resource utilization (office visits, ER visits, non-protocol diagnostic \ntests) will be applied according to the Medicare Fee Schedule, and skilled nursing facility and \nrehabilitation stays will be estimated using Medicare reimbursement rates.  Medication costs will \nbe estimated based on an average per subject per month cost for each medication class.  The \nmean cost for each class of medication will be based on an analysis of managed care pharmacy \nclaims for subjects with coronary artery disease.  \n\n \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 125 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n17.5. Analytic Plan \n \n\n17.5.1. Quality of Life Endpoints \n \nSince quality of life is a multidimensional construct for which different subjects may have different \nindividual preferences, no specific scale will be considered as the \u201cprimary\u201d QoL endpoint of the \nEXCEL trial.

For these cross-sectional analyses, comparisons will be performed at each follow-up \ntimepoint using analysis of covariance to adjust for any baseline differences, including baseline \nscore, between the treatment groups.  Second, in order to account for missing data, longitudinal \nrandom coefficient growth curve models will be used to examine the effect of CABG versus PCI \nover time on each health status/QoL outcome.  These models readily accommodate linear and \nnonlinear changes over time, as well as missing data patterns commonly seen in longitudinal \nstudies.  These analyses will incorporate all available QoL scores including those for subjects \nwho die, withdraw from the study, or are lost to follow-up.  Variables included in the longitudinal \nmodels for each outcome will include treatment (according to intention to treat), follow-up time \n(using linear, quadratic, and cubic terms), and interactions between treatment and each time \nterm. In addition, these analyses will adjust for any baseline sociodemographic and clinical \nfactors that differ between the two groups. \n \n\nA particular challenge in the analysis of quality of life data relates to the problem of missing data \n(due to death, incapacity, subject refusal, or loss to follow-up).   The proposed analytic strategy \nassumes that measurements are missing at random, however it is possible that subjects with impaired \nquality of life may be less likely to complete the interview. The sensitivity of the results to a variety of \nalternative assumptions regarding the relationship between quality of life and the likelihood of \ncompleting the QoL questionnaires will be examined.  Potential approaches will include imputing \nmissing values with the natural \u201cworst case\u201d score for each of the quality of life endpoints and \napplication of multiple imputation techniques.169\n\n \n \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 126 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n17.5.2. Exploratory Analyses:  Impact of Events on Quality-Adjusted Life \n Expectancy \n\n \nOne of the secondary goals of this study is to better understand the relative impact of outcome \nevents on overall subject health.  For these analyses, the longitudinal growth curve models to \nestimate quality of life over time for the two treatment groups will be used. Similar to the \napproach described above, these analyses will incorporate all available QoL scores including \nthose for subjects who die, withdraw from the study, or are lost to follow-up. Variables included \nin the longitudinal models for each outcome will include treatment (according to intention to \ntreat), follow-up time (using linear, quadratic, and cubic terms), and interactions between \ntreatment and each time term.   In addition, a broad range of baseline sociodemographic and \nclinical characteristics will be included. Finally, these models will include terms for each \noutcome variable of interest including myocardial infarction, stroke, and the occurrence of one or \nmore repeat revascularization procedures (as time-dependent covariates).  The interpretation of \nthese analyses will be focused on the beta coefficients, which will indicate the independent impact \nof each outcome event on the various health status domains (including utility weights) for subjects \nundergoing revascularization for left main disease. \n\n \n17.5.3. Cost and Resource Use Comparisons \n\n \nThe primary endpoints for the cost analysis will be total cardiovascular-related health care costs at \n3 years.  Because of concerns that extreme cost outliers may be driven by unobserved factors \nunrelated to the study, all cost data will be censored at the upper 99th percentile to limit the \nimpact of any such high-cost outliers. \n \n\nHealth economic decisions regarding the efficient allocation of scarce resources involve \nconsideration of the total costs of treating all subjects with a specific disease with the particular \ntreatment in question.  In such settings it is the arithmetic mean, which is the per-person cost of \nimplementing the treatment or intervention that is the most relevant measure for summarizing \nand comparing cost.170   Characteristics of cost distributions can complicate the task of the data \nanalyst needing to carry out a formal comparison of mean costs, however.  The distribution of \ncost data tends to be skewed, with a large proportion of costs at the lower end of the distribution \nand a long right tail.  As the appropriateness of many statistical tests and models relies on an \napproximately normal underlying distribution of the data, many common tests, such as the two- \nsample t test for the comparison of means, may not be appropriate. \n \n\nStatistical inference for all cost endpoints will therefore be performed by means of the non- \nparametric bootstrapping.171   Use of this approach avoids making any parametric assumptions \nregarding the  sampling distribution of  a  statistic by  deriving an  empirical estimate of  the \nsampling distribution by drawing a large number of samples with replacement form the original \ndata.  The statistic of interest is then calculated for each of the samples, and the bootstrap \nreplicates of the original sample yield an empirical estimate of the sampling distribution.  The \nbootstrap approach has been advocated as a preferred method for testing hypotheses, particularly \nwith relatively modest sample sizes, because it can be more accurate than tests based on \nasymptotic approximations.  For each comparison, an expected difference for the two treatment \ngroups and an associated 95% confidence interval based on bootstrap resampling will be \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 127 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\ncalculated. \n \n\n17.5.4. Cost-Effectiveness Analyses \n \nCost effectiveness will be expressed in terms of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, \ncomparing the more effective treatment (Treatment A) to the less effective treatment (Treatment \nB).  The cost-effectiveness ratio is calculated as: \n \n\nMean Cost (Treatment A) \u2013 Mean Cost (Treatment B) \nEffectiveness (A) \u2013 Effectiveness (B) \n\nwhere effectiveness is measured either in terms of quality-adjusted life years, life-years, or in \nterms of the proportion of subjects experiencing a major adverse event (death, MI, stroke +/- \nrepeat revascularization).  For the purposes of these analyses, all costs will be expressed in \nconstant dollars and both future costs and quality-adjusted life years will be discounted at \n3%/year, consistent with current guidelines. 172  For each analysis, a cost-effectiveness \nacceptability curve to relate any specific cost-effectiveness threshold to the probability of \ntreatment A being cost-effective at that threshold will be constructed. \n \n\n17.5.5. Lifetime Cost-Effectiveness \n \nIf there are important differences in irreversible clinical outcomes between the PCI and CABG \ngroups, a life-time cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed in addition to the within-trial \nanalysis described above.  For this analysis, the data from the in-trial analysis to project life- \nexpectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy for each surviving subject will be used, \ncontingent on the observed clinical outcomes during the trial. If there are differences in survival, \nthe remaining life-expectancy for the two treatment groups will be estimated by relating the \nobserved annual follow-up mortality to the mortality that would have been predicted based on a \ncomparable age- and gender-matched U.S. population.173   Quality-adjusted life expectancy will \nbe calculated by assuming that each subjects\u2019 health status remains unchanged beyond the last \nobservation in the trial. \n \n\nOn the other hand, if there are differences in other non-fatal outcomes but not survival, a state- \ntransition (Markov) model will be developed to project lifetime costs, survival, and quality- \nadjusted life expectancy for each treatment group.174   The model will be developed based on the \nobserved within-trial data and calibrated to match the 3-year outcomes (in terms of aggregate \ncosts and quality-adjusted life-expectancy) for the two treatment groups.  Under this approach, \nstandard one-way, multi-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses will also be performed to \nexplore the impact of plausible variations in the assumptions on the incremental cost- \neffectiveness ratios. \n \n\n17.5.6. Evaluation of Heterogeneity by Country \n \nGiven that the primary cost-effectiveness analysis will be based on approximately 1800 patients of \nEXCEL trial population, a series of heterogeneity tests will be performed to identify whether it is \nappropriate to generalize these results to the U.S. as a whole or whether an analysis based \nspecifically on U.S. subjects is more appropriate.175Although heterogeneity in terms of costs and \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 128 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\nclinical outcomes can be evaluated through standard statistical techniques and interaction tests, \nheterogeneity in cost-effectiveness results will be evaluated using a net benefit regression \napproach through the use of country by treatment group interaction terms. 176 Because of the \ninherently low power of these tests, clinical outcomes, resource use, and cost and cost- \neffectiveness results will be stratified by country as well, in an effort to identify countries with \nmarkedly outlying clinical, economic or cost-effectiveness outcomes.  If important heterogeneity is \ndetected, results for a particular country may need to be based on the individual country data or \non pooled data with other countries with comparable outcomes and resource use. \n \n\n17.5.7. Subgroup Analyses \n \nIn addition to each of the main analyses specified above, each of the cost and cost-effectiveness \nanalyses will be performed on several pre-specified subgroups of interest.  These subgroups will \ninclude diabetic vs. non-diabetic subjects, type of left main disease (ostium/shaft vs. distal \nbifurcation), terciles of angiographic complexity (by SYNTAX score), 7 age subgroups (<65, 65-\n75, >75), gender, and U.S. vs. non-U.S. subjects.  Additional subgroup analyses for the cost and \ncost-effectiveness calculations will be performed for any subject subgroups identified as \nclinically-relevant based on the main clinical outcomes as well. \n \n\n17.6. Approach to Unanticipated Protocol Modifications \n \nFinally, it  is  important to  note that in  contrast to  traditional statistical analyses which are \ndesigned to test a specific hypothesis, cost-effectiveness analyses are inherently descriptive.  As a \nresult, it may be the case that the analysis plan above may be modified as a result of unanticipated \ndata sources or results from the clinical trial.  Such modifications will be at the discretion of \nthe MAHI HETA group and will be reviewed by the Executive Committee of the EXCEL trial. \n \n\n17.7. Independence of Research \n \nIncreasing scientific scrutiny of cost-effective analysis has led to the recent development of \ngenerally-accepted guidelines for the conduct of industry-sponsored cost-effectiveness \nresearch.177Such guidelines are necessary to ensure the independence of the investigators and \nthus to establish the scientific validity and credibility of the research.

APPENDIX C: IVUS SUBSTUDY \n \nThe IVUS substudy will explore whether procedural use of IVUS improves outcomes of left \nmain stenting, as well as determine the IVUS parameters that most strongly correlate with left \nmain stent thrombosis or restenosis. Although in this regard a randomized trial would be ideal, \nthe current protocol is already sufficiently complex such that adding another level of \nrandomization is not practical. Moreover, although assessment of minimal luminal area by IVUS is \nrelatively simple, not all sites are expert in the use of IVUS guidance for complex left main \nstenoses. Therefore, the potential utility of IVUS guidance in improving the acute and late results \nof left main stenting with the XIENCE stent will be determined from a multivariable and \npropensity adjusted non randomized analysis of the outcomes based on IVUS usage. All left \nmain lesions in which IVUS was used will undergo rigorous core laboratory evaluation. The \nprincipal events to be analyzed according to IVUS use will be procedural success and \ncomplications, MACE, TLR and stent thrombosis, both on a subject level (all lesions) and \nadjudicated to those adverse events arising from the left main lesion. \n \n\n \n \nAnalyses to be performed: \n \n\n\u2022 PCI outcomes according to  IVUS  use  on  a  subject  level.  The  outcomes of  subjects \nundergoing PCI will be compared according to the frequency of left main IVUS use for \nprocedural guidance. The results will be adjusted by differences in baseline clinical and \nangiographic characteristics between the subjects and lesions in the 2 groups (IVUS used vs. \nnot used for procedural guidance), including the use of a propensity score for IVUS \nguidance. In addition, propensity analysis will be used to create 2 matched groups with \n100% vs. 0% left main IVUS guidance for comparison of procedural and late outcomes. \n\n \n\n\u2022 PCI outcomes according to IVUS use on a site level. The outcomes in the upper 50% of \nsites according to left main IVUS guidance will be compared to the lower 50% of sites \naccording to left main IVUS guidance. The results will be adjusted by differences in baseline \nclinical and angiographic characteristics between the subjects and lesions in the 2 groups, \nincluding the use of a propensity score for IVUS guidance.

Among subjects undergoing left main IVUS guided \nintervention, the univariate and multivariable IVUS predictors of TLR, stent thrombosis and \nMACE will be determined, and the incremental value of IVUS variables in predicting adverse \noutcomes will be analyzed. The primary hypotheses will be that MACE will be inversely \npredicted by minimal stent area (MSA). Radiofrequency IVUS parameters will also be \ncollected for analysis of relationship of pre-stent and post\u2013stent plaque morphology to \nsubsequent MACE. \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 130 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n19.   APPENDIX D: OPTIMAL REVASCULARIZATION DEFINITIONS \n \nNumerous prior studies have attempted to determine the differences in the extent of \nrevascularization between CABG and PCI, and whether complete vs. incomplete revascularization \nis prognostically important with either modality.  The results of these studies have been \nextremely inconsistent, with limitations including: 1) different definitions for complete \nrevascularization used for PCI and CABG; 2) different definitions for complete revascularization \nused between studies; 3) definitions created and applied post hoc; 4) use of operator \nassessment to determine the extent of revascularization, rather than independent committee; 5) \nsample size and follow-up duration limitations; 6) analysis of varying subgroups; 7) lack of \ndistinction between the extent of anatomic and ischemic revascularization. \n \n\nEXCEL is a large-scale, multicenter, prospective trial in which subjects with coronary artery \ndisease will undergo surgical or percutaneous revascularization and be followed for a minimum of \n5 years.  EXCEL will employ comprehensive angiographic core laboratory analysis and an \nindependent clinical events committee to adjudicate events.  This affords an opportunity to pre- \nspecify criteria and methodology for analysis of the impact of the extent of anatomic and \nischemic revascularization in subjects undergoing PCI and CABG. \n \n\n19.1. Principles: \n \n1)  The same criteria for complete revascularization should apply for PCI and CABG \n \n\n2)  The importance of the extent of anatomic vs. ischemic revascularization should be \n differentiated (which is prognostically more useful, and how much overlap there is between \n the two) \n \n\n3)  The extent of revascularization will be determined by independent committees and core \n laboratories (i.e. not the treating physician) using pre-specified definitions and methodology \n \n\n4)  The significance of complete vs. incomplete revascularization will be assessed in each study \n for the primary and major secondary endpoint, as well as for death, repeat revascularization \n and QoL in all subjects, and in subsets of subjects with a) normal vs. depressed LVEF; b) \n CTOs vs. no CTOs; c) diabetics vs. non diabetics; d) LAD vs. non LAD disease and/or \n complete revascularization (includes left main disease in subjects without significant LAD \n disease) \n \n\n5)  The implications of revascularization of non ischemic vessels (deleterious effect) will be \n determined by analysis of subjects with complete ischemic vs. \u201cpotentially excessive\u201d \n revascularization \n \n\n6)  Revascularization will be defined as complete (all significant lesions revascularized as \n determined by the core laboratory), vs. incomplete. Incomplete revascularization will be \n further subdivided into 1 vs. 2 or more non revascularized territories, and to LAD vs. non \n LAD non revascularized territories.  The implications of incomplete revascularization will \n also be defined according to the non revascularized myocardial jeopardy score. \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 131 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n19.2. Anatomic revascularization: \n \n1)  Complete anatomic revascularization requires revascularization of all vessels \u22652.0 mm \n\nreference vessel diameter with a DS \u226560% (both as measured by core angiographic \nlaboratory analysis). \n\n \n\n - While this will be the pre-specified criteria for anatomically significant lesions, sensitivity \nanalysis will be performed using different criteria (e.g. \u22652.5 mm vessels, DS \u226570%, etc.) \n\n \n\n2)  From the baseline angiogram, the angiographic core lab will identify and designate \nthose lesions and vessels requiring revascularization in all subjects according to this definition, \nprior to knowledge of the extent of actual revascularization. \n\n \n\n Contrast dye used in angiography may cause allergy, bradycardia, hypotension, renal \ndysfunction, decreased contractility, heart failure and fluid overload. Such risks are reported \nin <5% of the patients.

However, routine post operative angiography is not standard of \ncare, and is not recommended as a substudy as it could affect clinical event rates. \n\n \n19.3. Ischemic revascularization: \n\n \n1)   Complete ischemic revascularization requires revascularization of all vessels containing \n\nlesions with a core laboratory diameter stenosis of \u226550% with any of the following: \n \n\na) noninvasive evidence of ischemia in that territory regardless of vessel size. If by \nangiographic core laboratory analysis there is more than one lesion with diameter \nstenosis \u226550% or more than one vessel containing lesions with diameter stenosis \n\u226550% in the ischemic territory, complete revascularization requires treatment of all \nsuch lesions and vessels with reference vessel diameter \u22652.0 mm; OR \n\n \n\nb) lesions in vessels with reference vessel diameter \u22652.0 mm with either IVUS \nMLA \u22644 mm2 + plaque burden \u226560%, and/or FF\u22640.80; OR \n\n \n\nc) an angiographic core lab DS \u226570% with \u22652.0 mm reference vessel diameter, \nunless FFR and/or IVUS criteria above are negative, or the vessel subtends  non-\nviable myocardium as demonstrated by either perfusion imaging or akinesis  \n\n \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 132 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n(Note: this is a practical definition \u2013 some cases of hibernating myocardium may be \nmissed). \n\n \n\n- For assessment of the completeness of ischemic revascularization, physiologic \nsignificance \u201ctrumps\u201d anatomic severity. e.g. If the angiographic diameter \nstenosis is >70% but the FFR is >0.80, that lesion does not require treatment for \nischemic revascularization to be considered complete. \n\n \n\n3)  The angiographic core lab will determine the extent of revascularization in both groups by \nreview of baseline functional tests, angiograms, cath reports (for IVUS and FFR results) and \nop notes (note \u2013 source documents need to be collected) \n\n  \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 133 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n20.

Prior to Randomization \n \nIf the ULMCA lesion is intermediate (\u226550% and <70% by angiographic visual estimate) without a  \nmarkedly positive noninvasive test (see Section 6.5.1 \u2013 inclusion criteria): either IVUS (strongly \nrecommended) or FFR (alternatively) must be performed for the subject to qualify for \nrandomization. \n \n\n20.1.2. IVUS Criteria \n \nIVUS criteria to defer revascularization of the ULMCA and not randomize subjects into the \nstudy is a ULMCA minimum lumen area (MLA) >6.0 mm2.178   Conversely, if the MLA is \u22646.0 \nmm2, the ULMCA lesion may be considered to be hemodynamically significant and subject may \nbe randomized.  In order to determine the true MLA in the ULMCA, it may be necessary to \nimage back to the aorto-ostial junction from both the LAD and LCX; the smaller of the two \nMLAs is the more accurate and should be used for decision-making.  Practically, however, this is \nonly necessary if the first pullback shows an MLA >6.0 mm2.

The pressure wire transducer should be positioned just distal to \nthe ULMCA lesion and proximal to any secondary lesions, as long as there is a major branch \nafter the left main which appears angiographically nearly normal for adequate runoff (e.g. the \nLAD or a large diagonal). \n \n\nNote: See figure below.  If there is also a tight stenosis in the proximal LAD distal to the \nULMCA bifurcation lesion, and the FFR transducer is placed between these lesions, FFR may be \nfalse negative (>0.80); if the transducer is placed distal to a second hemodynamically significant \nlesion, the FFR may be false positive (\u22640.80); therefore, IVUS evaluation is strongly preferred in \nmost scenarios except to assess an isolated borderline left main stenosis. \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 135 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nPossible False Negative \n\n \nPossible False Positive \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nLAD \n \n \n\nLCX \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\nFor subjects who meet all eligibility criteria for randomization, except that either the \ninterventional cardiologist or cardiac surgeon on the local Heart Team (or both) believe that the \nULMCA diameter stenosis is visually assessed to be \u226550% - <70% stenotic without clear \nnoninvasive evidence demonstrating hemodynamic significance of the ULMCA lesion (see \nSection 6.5.1 \u2013 inclusion criteria), consent for the randomized trial can be obtained pre- \ncatheterization.

If ULMCA disease extends into the ostial/proximal \nLAD (as it does in the majority of subjects), it is recommended that stent length be selected so as \nto end the stent in a segment of LAD with a plaque burden <50%. While there are no IVUS \ncriteria for selecting a one-stent (cross-over) vs. a two-stent strategy, in general a LCX ostium \nlumen area >4.0 mm2 or a plaque burden \u226460% in a short segment of disease may indicate that a \none-stent (cross-over) strategy will be adequate. \n \n\nIterative IVUS and post-dilation should be performed until the ULMCA minimum stent area is \n>8.5mm2 and the ostial/proximal LAD minimum stent area is at least >5.5mm2 and preferably \nmatched to the distal reference vessel diameter if larger. Observational data in non-LMCA \nlesions has shown that in general the larger the minimal stent area the lower the likelihood of \nrestenosis and stent thrombosis183, 184, 185 and thus post-dilation with non compliant balloons sized \nup to 0.25-0.5mm less than the IVUS determined true vessel diameter (average media-media \ndimension) to safely achieve the largest maximal luminal dimension is recommended. It is \nstrongly recommended that IVUS is also performed post-LMCA stenting from at least one \nepicardial coronary artery, usually the LAD, with pullback into the aorta (disengaging the guide to \nensure the ostium is not missed). If a 1-stent technique is used (most commonly from the \nULMCA into the LAD, \u201ccrossing over\u201d the LCX), it is desirable but not mandatory that the \nostial LCX also be imaged post-intervention if possible. If a 2-stent technique is used, IVUS \npullback across the LAD and LCX is strongly recommended if the IVUS catheter passes easily \ninto the LCX. LCX or side branch imaging should not be pursued aggressively to avoid IVUS- \nrelated (or pressure wire-related) complications. If the IVUS catheter or pressure wire can be \nsafely positioned into the LCX, then, in general, an LCX ostium lumen area >4.0mm2 (single \nstent strategy) or >5.5mm2 (two stent strategy) or an FFR >0.80 (single stent strategy) indicates \nthat no further intervention is necessary. \n \n\nSevere dissections present by IVUS (residual true lumen within the dissection flap \u22648.5mm2 in \nthe ULMCA either proximal or distal to the stent or \u22645.5mm2 in the proximal LAD or LCX \ndistal to the stent) should in general receive an additional stent. Malapposition with stent area \n\u22648.5mm2 in the ULMCA or \u22645.5mm2 in the proximal LAD or LCX should in general be treated \nby additional post-dilatation with larger balloons. \n \n \n \n \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 138 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n20.3. IVUS and FFR for Guidance of Non-ULMCA Lesion PCI \n\n \n20.3.1. Pre-intervention non-ULMCA lesion assessment \n\n \nTo avoid unnecessary interventions with subsequent peri-procedural and late myocardial \ninfarctions and repeat revascularization procedures139  PCI of non ischemia producing lesions \nshould in general not be performed. Whereas IVUS is strongly recommended (preferable to FFR) to \nassess intermediate ULMCA stenoses, it is just as strongly recommended that FFR be performed \n(preferable to IVUS) in all intermediate non-LMCA lesions (those with an angiographic diameter \nstenosis <70% by visual estimate), unless there is a positive nuclear or echocardiographic \nnoninvasive study with ischemia clearly present in the distribution of that lesion. In the setting \nof serial stenoses, stenting should only be performed if the FFR beyond all narrowings is \n\u22640.80138. Under maximum intravenous hyperemia (140 \u00b5g/kg/min IV adenosine for at least 3 \nminutes, or until peak hyperemia is observed), the pressure sensor is pulled back by hand slowly \nunder fluoroscopic guidance, and the pressure curves are recorded.  If the FFR is 0.81 or 0.82, \nincreasing the intravenous adenosine to 280 \u00b5g/kg/min for at least 3 minutes, or until peak \nhyperemia is observed may demonstrate that the lesion is hemodynamically significant (FFR \ndecreases to \u22640.80), warranting treatment. The investigator should first stent the stenosis that \nappears most significant or is responsible for the largest pressure gradient during pullback of the \npressure sensor. After stenting the first lesion, FFR is measured again and any residual narrowing \ncausing an FFR \u22640.80 is stented. (Note: for all FFR procedures, intravenous adenosine is required \nas opposed to intracoronary adenosine to ensure optimal coronary vasodilatation, and because \nintravenous adenosine provides prolonged hyperemia allowing adequate time to perform pullback \nof the pressure wire and localize pressure gradients.) \n \n\nFor sites that do not use FFR, it is strongly recommended that pre-interventional IVUS is used in \nall intermediate lesions (those with a visually estimated angiographic stenosis of <70% (unless \nthere is a positive nuclear or echocardiographic noninvasive study with ischemia clearly present in \nthe distribution of that lesion). A significant lesion by IVUS criteria that should be stented has  \n\nboth a minimal luminal area (MLA) of \u22644 mm2and a plaque burden of >60%. In the absence of \nextenuating circumstances (e.g. plaque rupture, etc.), lesions that do not have both of these \ncriteria should not undergo PCI. \n \n\n20.3.2. IVUS guidance of non-ULMCA stenting \n \nIf IVUS is used to guide treatment of ULMCA lesions, it is recommended that IVUS also be \nused to guide treatment of important non-LMCA lesions in the LAD, LCX, and RCA \ncirculations. XIENCE stent size and length should be selected and optimized to achieve a \nminimum stent area >5.5mm2 in non ULMCA lesions (with post-dilation with non compliant \nballoons sized up to 0.25-0.5mm less than the IVUS determined true vessel diameter (average \nmedia-to-media dimension), and to end the stents in arterial segments with a plaque burden \n<50%.  Severe dissections present by IVUS (residual true lumen within the dissection flap \n\u22645.5mm2 either proximal or distal to the stent) should in general receive an additional stent. \nMalapposition with stent area \u22645.5mm2 should in general be treated by additional post-dilatation \nwith larger balloons. \n \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 139 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n20.4. Follow-up \n \nSince the site of restenosis after distal ULMCA bifurcation intervention is typically the ostium of \nthe LCX, and since many presumed ostial LCX restenoses are angiographic artifacts (i.e. appear \nangiographically severe, but in fact are not hemodynamically significant),68 it is strongly \nrecommended that FFR be performed before treating any presumed restenotic lesions in the \nostial LCX location (regardless of angiographic severity, unless totally occluded) unless there is \nunequivocal lateral wall ischemia by nuclear or echocardiographic noninvasive testing. If the \nFFR is >0.80, the ostial LCX lesion should not be treated and, thus, TLR (and possible procedural \ncomplications) avoided.  For sites that do not use FFR, it is strongly recommended that pre-\ninterventional IVUS of the ostial LCX be performed instead with an MLA >4.0mm2 used as \nthe criteria to defer intervention and avoid TLR.186  Similarly, prior to performing a repeat \nintervention elsewhere in the coronary tree, if the visually assessed angiographic diameter stenosis \nis <70%, ischemia should be documented according to either a positive nuclear or \nechocardiographic noninvasive test in the distribution of the recurrent lesion, or an FFR \u22640.80, or \nIVUS with a MLA \u22644.0 mm2. \n \n\n20.5. Technical Considerations \n \nIVUS should be performed using motorized transducer pullback at 0.5  mm/sec using \nonly sheath-based, rotating, mechanical transducers.  The pullback should start at least 1 cm distal \nto the lesion or stent, and conclude at least 1 cm proximal to the lesion or stent. \n \n\nFFR should be performed using intravenous adenosine infusion (140 \u00b5g/kg/min) for at least \n3 minutes or until maximal hyperemia is achieved.  Occasionally doses as high as 280 \u00b5g/kg/min \nwill lead to a positive FFR when a lower dose did not.  To avoid turbulence, the pressure \ntransducer should be placed 2-3 cm beyond the lesion to be assessed. \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 140 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n21.

General Recommendations and Goals \n \n\n22.1.1. Smoking \nAll subjects who are smokers should enter a smoking cessation program (or practice-based \ncounseling with nurse coordinators) with a focus upon quitting, avoiding relapses, and \nminimizing exposure to secondhand smoke.187, 188, 189\n\n \n \n\n22.1.2. Dietary and Weight Goals \n \nIn subjects with an initial BMI of between 25-27.5 (kg/m2) the goal should be a BMI of less than \n25 kg/m2.  If BMI is greater than 27.5, the goal is 10% relative weight loss. \n \n\nTable 22-2 lists waist circumference thresholds for abdominal obesity.  Although these are not in \nthemselves therapeutic targets, they are a useful screening tool for abdominal obesity as one of \nthe components of the metabolic syndrome. \n \n\nAn ideal diet should comprise less than 30% of calories as total fat and less than 7% of calories \nas saturated fat.  Dietary cholesterol should be limited to less than 200 mg per day, sodium less \nthan 2400 mg per day, and at least 2 servings of fish per week are recommended. \n \n\n22.1.3. Physical Activity \n \nPhysical activity goals are 30-60 minutes of moderate intensity exercise five or more times per \nweek.  Based upon evidence of contemporary cardiac rehabilitation programs and taking into \naccount that subjects in the EXCEL trial will have undergone coronary revascularization there \nshould be little concern in regard to ischemic risk from exercise training.  An exercise prescription \nbased upon the guidelines from the American Association of Cardiovascular Pulmonary \nRehabilitation and the American College of Sports Medicine may be prescribed. Specifics are \nfrequency of five or more times per week, an intensity based upon a resting heart rate plus 20 \nbeats per minute, a Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) of 11-13 (\u201cfairly light to somewhat \nhard\u201d), or below the subject\u2019s angina-ischemia threshold.  The duration should be 30-60 minutes \nand the modes include walking, treadmill, cycling, elliptical, rowing, stair climbing, or other.190, \n\n191\n \n\n \n22.1.4. Influenza Vaccination \n\n \nInfluenza vaccination should be encouraged on an annual basis for all subjects. \n \n\n22.1.5. Diabetes \n \nThe goals for diabetes management are to maintain fasting blood glucose levels between 80 to \n125 mg/dL (4.44 \u2013 7.49 mmol/L) and hemoglobin A1c levels of less than 7% in accordance with \npublished recommendations.192, 193, 194   More stringent goals, i.e., a hemoglobin A1c level of less \nthan 6%, can be considered in individual subjects. All subjects with hemoglobin A1c  levels of \ngreater than 7% should be referred to a diabetes clinic or a physician with expertise in the \nmanagement of diabetes.  Management will be in accordance with published guidelines and \nrecommendations.\n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 144 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n22.1.6. Lipid Goals \n \nAggressive lipid-lowering therapy is advocated with the primary goal being LDL cholesterol of \nless than 70 mg/dL (less than 1.8 mmol/L).188, 189,195, 196 Secondary goals including increasing the \nlevels of HDL cholesterol to greater than 40 mg/dL (greater than 1.0 mmol/L) for men and \ngreater than 50 mg/dL (greater than 1.3 mmol/L) for women.  Other secondary goals include \nmaintaining triglyceride levels below 150 mg/dL (less than 1.7 mmol/L), non-HDL cholesterol \nbelow 100 mg/dL (<2.6 mmol/L), and total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio of less than 4.0. \nFasting lipid profiles should be analyzed at baseline, 6 weeks after starting therapy, 6 months, \nand then annually throughout the trial but are not a protocol requirement. \n \n\n22.1.7. Hypertension \n \nThe goal is a blood pressure of less than 130/80 mmHg.  All subjects with hypertension \nwill receive lifestyle counseling focused on sodium restriction, weight loss, and exercise. \nMedications will be prescribed if necessary. \n \n\n22.2. Pharmacologic Therapy \n \nTable 22-3 lists the recommended drugs to be used for each condition and the indications for \ntherapy (Subject to modification, pending finalization and subsequent changes to ACC/AHA and \nESC clinical practice guidelines for stable and unstable ischemic heart disease).  Goals of \ntherapy are to achieve the desired level of risk factors and to control symptoms according to the \nsubject\u2019s individual tolerance of medications, so as to maintain an acceptable quality of life. \n \n\nTable 22-3       Pharmacologic Therapy Indications \nMedication Class Indication \n\nAspirin See Sections 7.6.2 and 7.7.3. \nThienopyridine See Sections 7.6.2 and 7.6.3 \nACE inhibitor Hypertension, diabetes, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, \n\nchronic kidney disease \nAngiotensin receptor blocker Individuals with hypertension, diabetes, left ventricular \n\nsystolic dysfunction, chronic kidney disease who are \nintolerant of ACE inhibitors \n\nBeta-blocker All post-MI subjects unless contraindicated1, all others2 \n\nThiazide diuretic Hypertension, as indicated \nCalcium antagonist Hypertension, angina/ischemia \nLong-acting nitrate Angina/ischemia \nLate inward Na+ current inhibitor: ranolazine Angina/ischemia \nOther anti-anginal agents: ivabradine, \ntrimetazadine, nicorandil \n\nAngina/ischemia \n\nStatin All subjects \n \n\n \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 145 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\nMedication Class Indication \n\nNiacin: extended-release niacin LDL >70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), non-HDL >100 mg/dL (2.6 \nmmol/L) if TG >150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) on statin; HDL < \n40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L) in men, HDL < 50 mg/dL (1.3 \nmmol/L in women \n\nCholesterol absorption inhibitor: ezetimibe LDL >70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) on maximally-tolerated dose \nof statin \n\nBile acid sequestrant LDL >70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) on maximally-tolerated dose \nof statin \n\nFibrate TG >10 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) on statin (not recommended for \nlow HDL when TG < 150 mg/dL (1.69 mmol/L) \n\nOmega-3 fatty acids All subjects receive 1 gm/d; 2-4 gm/d to lower non-HDL \n<100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) \n\nACE=angiotensin converting enzyme; HDL=high density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL=low density lipoprotein cholesterol; \nLVEF=left ventricular ejection fraction; MI=myocardial infarction; TG=triglycerides \n1Class IA recommendation according to ACC/AHA guidelines \n2Class IB recommendation according to ACC/AHA guidelines \n\n \n22.2.1.

Treatment of Hypertension \n \nThe overall goal of therapy for hypertension is to provide maximal protection against \ncardiovascular consequences with minimal side effects.  There remains, however, some \nuncertainty with regard to which drug should be used and in what order. \n \n\nSince all subjects in this trial have symptomatic coronary artery disease, initial therapy should be \nan angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or a beta-blocker.  If the goal blood \npressure is not reached, the next step is the addition of a diuretic or a calcium-channel \nblocker.  All subjects should be on a beta blocker and an ACE-I prior to the addition of other \nagents.  If there are contraindications to use, side effects, or blood pressure is not controlled, \nsubjects should be referred to the principal investigator for further consultation.  An ACE-I or \nangiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be administered to all subjects with diabetes, left \nventricular systolic dysfunction, and/or chronic kidney disease. \n \n\n22.2.3.

Other options if the triglycerides \nare less than or equal to 200 mg/dL (2.3 mmol/L) are to add a bile acid sequestrant such as  \ncolesevelam 6 tablets daily or 3 tablets twice per day with a meal and liquid or ezetimibe 10 mg  \ndaily.  If triglycerides are greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL (greater than 2.3 mmol/L) add \neither Tricor (fenofibrate) 145 mg per day or fish oils up to a dose of 4 gm daily.  If subject still \ndoes not reach lipid goals, the principal investigator should be consulted. \n \n\n22.2.4. Anti-anginal Therapy \n \nAll subjects should receive sublingual nitroglycerin for pain relief and prophylaxis. The choice \nbetween beta blockers and calcium channel blockers for first line anti-anginal therapy is not clear \ncut but in general, beta-blockers are advised as initial therapy, particularly in subjects with \nhypertension, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and/or a history of myocardial infarction. \nAbsolute contraindications to beta-blockers are severe resting sinus bradycardia, pre-existing \nsecond degree AV block, sick sinus node syndrome, asthma of at least moderate severity, or \ndecompensated (class IV) heart failure.   Most diabetics and subjects with chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease but without frank bronchospasm will tolerate beta blockers although close \nmonitoring is recommended. \n \n\nSubsequent steps include the addition of drugs not already utilized, e.g., the addition of a calcium \nchannel-blocker, long-acting nitrate, or ranolazine in subjects already on a beta-blocker. \nConversely, the addition of a beta-blocker to subjects who are already on a calcium-channel \nblocker should be considered. \n \n\nNew anti-anginal agents such as Trimetazidine (approved for use in Europe) and Ivabradine \n(approved for use in Europe) may be tried in selected subjects. \n \n\n22.2.5. Vitamin Supplementation \n \nVitamin supplementation with vitamin E, folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 are not \nrecommended.  Although the evidence for vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor for CAD is \ngrowing, evidence for vitamin D supplementation as effective secondary prevention is lacking. \nVitamin D supplementation is therefore not currently recommended, but may be considered if \nnew evidence emerges during the course of the trial as appropriate, depending on results from \ntwo large ongoing trials. \n\n", "\nConfidential and Proprietary \nDo not distribute or reproduce without prior permission of Abbott Vascular Inc. \n\nAbbott Vascular  Version 10.0, 08 FEB 2016 \nProtocol 10-389: EXCEL Trial  Page 147 of 169 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n23.
