The P2-VP8 \\nvaccine contains a truncated rotavirus VP8 subunit fused to the tetanus toxin \\nP2 CD4 epitope. It is parenterally administered, which may overcome \\nlimitations of oral vaccines in developing countries. A monovalent formulation \\ncontaining the VP8 subunit from a P[8] rotavirus strain has been \\ndemonstrated to be well-tolerated and immunogenic in US adults (VAC 009) \\nand is currently being tested in toddlers and infants in South Africa (VAC \\n013), where it has been generally well-tolerated. In the study in adults, the \\nmonovalent vaccine elicited robust neutralizing antibody responses to several \\nhomologous P[8] strains of rotavirus, but modest response to P[4] strains and \\nmeager responses to P[6] strains. Thus, the trivalent formulation to be tested \\nin this study, containing VP8 subunits from P[4], P[6] and P[8] strains was \\ndeveloped, with the goal to optimize responses to those strains that account \\nfor the vast majority of the burden of rotavirus disease globally. Preclinical \\nstudies of the trivalent vaccine indicate improved responses to P[4] and P[6] \\nstrains. Preliminary analysis of serologic responses and impact of the \\nmonovalent P2-VP8 vaccine on shedding of Rotarix, as a proxy model for \\nefficacy, in infants in VAC 013 has provided promising results. Those results \\nhave also provided the basis for the selection of the dose levels of the \\ntrivalent vaccine to be tested in this protocol. \\n\\nINVESTIGATIONAL \\nPRODUCTS \\n\\nVaccine: The TV P2-VP8 subunit rotavirus vaccine produced in E. coli is \\nadsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide (0.5625 mg/dose). Three dose levels of \\nvaccine will be tested: 15 µg, 30 µg and 90 µg (consisting of equal amounts \\nof VP8 antigen derived from a P[4], a P[6] and a P[8] strain of rotavirus), all to \\nbe administered in 0.5 mL volumes intramuscularly. The three antigens are \\nderived from DS1, 1076 and Wa strains, respectively. \\n \\nPlacebo: Normal Saline (NS) \\n\\nSTUDY \\nPOPULATION \\n\\n• 30 healthy South African adults (18-45 years old, inclusive, at time of first \\nvaccination)  \\n\\n• 30 healthy South African toddlers (≥2 & < 3 years old at time of first \\nvaccination) \\n\\n• 600 healthy South African infants (≥6 & <8 weeks old at the time of first \\nvaccination) \\n\\nSTUDY DURATION Adult and infant participants will be followed for approximately 8 months after \\nrandomization (6 months following last [3rd] injection).

The two dose levels \\nof vaccine to be tested will be 30 µg (consisting of 10 µg each of the P[4], \\nP[6] and P[8] P2-VP8 subunit proteins) and 90 µg (consisting of 30 µg each \\nof the P[4], P[6] and P[8] P2-VP8 subunit proteins). Progression from low- to \\nhigh-dose in adults, and to low-dose in toddlers, will be based on assessment \\nof safety and tolerability during the week after the first injection in the adult \\nlow-dose cohort. The adult cohorts will receive a series of 3 study injections \\nto allow optimal comparison with the results of the VAC 009 study, in which \\nUS adults received a series of 3 study injections of the monovalent vaccine \\n(containing P[8] only, up to 60 µg). \\n\\nSimilarly, the toddler cohorts (Cohorts B1 and B2) will consist of 15 participants \\n(12 vaccine recipients and 3 placebo recipients) per dose level. Participants \\nwill receive a single intramuscular injection. If found to be safe in the adult \\ncohorts, the two dose levels of vaccine to be tested will be 30 µg (consisting \\nof 10 µg each of the P[4], P[6] and P[8] P2-VP8 subunit proteins) and 90 µg \\n(consisting of 30 µg each of the P[4], P[6] and P[8] P2-VP8 subunit proteins). \\nInitiation of the toddler low-dose cohort will be based on assessment of safety \\nand tolerability of that dose during the week after the first injection in the adult \\nlow-dose cohort. Progression from low- to high-dose in the toddlers, and to \\nlow-dose in infants, will be based on assessment of safety and tolerability \\nduring the week after the first injection in the toddler low-dose cohort. Further, \\nprogression to the high-dose in toddlers will also be based on assessment of \\nsafety and tolerability during the week after first injection in the adult high-\\ndose cohort. The toddler cohorts will receive only one study injection, as was \\nthe case for toddlers in VAC 013, as it is the safety data following this single \\ndose that will be assessed to determine whether to proceed to the infant \\ncohorts. \\n\\nInitial assessment in infants will consist of 16 participants (12 vaccine \\nrecipients and 4 placebo recipients) per dose level (Cohorts C1, C2 and C3). \\nParticipants will receive three intramuscular injections four weeks apart. If \\nfound to be safe in the toddler cohorts, the three dose levels of vaccine to be \\ntested will be 15 µg (consisting of 5 µg each of the P[4], P[6] and P[8] P2-VP8 \\nsubunit proteins), 30 µg (consisting of 10 µg each of the P[4], P[6] and P[8] \\nP2-VP8 subunit proteins) and 90 µg (consisting of 30 µg each of the P[4], \\nP[6] and P[8] P2-VP8 subunit proteins).

BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION\\n1.1. Burden of Disease\\nDiarrhea is the second-leading cause of death worldwide among children under the age of five, \\nkilling an estimated 1.3 million annually and hospitalizing millions more, mostly in developing \\ncountries [1]. The most common cause of severe infantile diarrhea is rotavirus; almost all \\nchildren are infected with rotavirus before their third birthday regardless of geographic location \\nor economic status. Global surveillance indicates that rotavirus is associated with up to 40 \\npercent of severe, dehydrating diarrheal episodes in young children, resulting in hospitalization \\nand more than 450,000 deaths each year. More than 85 percent of these deaths occur in the \\nworld’s poorest countries [1]. Children in low-income countries are at greater risk of severe \\nrotavirus disease because they are more likely to be infected earlier in life, access to urgent \\nmedical care can be limited or unavailable, and there is a greater prevalence of malnutrition and \\nother co-morbidities. In addition to causing loss of life, rotavirus places a burden on health-care \\nsystems and families. Vaccination offers the best hope for protecting all infants, regardless of \\neconomic status, against rotavirus disease [2]. \\n\\n1.2. Pathogen \\nRotavirus infection is primarily acquired through the fecal oral route. Universal infection in both \\ndeveloping and developed countries indicate that improved sanitation alone will not control \\nrotavirus infection [3]. Treatment is symptomatic, with an emphasis on maintaining hydration \\neither by oral administration of fluids or, in severe disease, via the intravenous route, with a \\nfavorable prognosis [4]. Unfortunately, provision of such rudimentary supportive care in many \\nimpoverished areas of the world is limited, contributing to the high mortality rate observed.  \\n\\nThe vast majority of human disease (~90%) is caused by group A rotavirus. Two surface \\nproteins, VP4 and VP7, are able to induce neutralizing antibody during infection, and both are \\nvery divergent across different rotavirus strains: the VP7 glycoprotein represents the G \\nserotype, while the VP4 protein represents the P serotype. The seroepidemiology of rotavirus \\nstrains causing human disease has been extensively studied [5]. The findings have potentially \\nimportant implications for vaccine development. While geographical differences have been \\nnoted in the absolute frequency of the various P serotypes, the P[4] and P[8] serotypes \\npredominate (Figure 2, below), accounting for between 90-99% of strains isolated from Asia, \\nNorth America, Europe, South America and Australia/Oceania. However, in Africa they \\nrepresent approximately 70% of clinical isolates with P[6] accounting for nearly all of the \\nremaining strains. There is no clear evidence that protection against rotavirus infection is \\nexclusively homotypic, but if that were the case, a bivalent vaccine that contains P[4] and P[8] \\nwould provide 90% coverage in all areas except Africa. For Africa, a P[6] component would be \\nrequired for a similar rate of coverage. However, more recent data indicate the prevalence of \\nP[6] currently may be about half of previous estimates [6, 7]. In contrast, the diversity among G \\nserotypes is greater, with 4-5 serotypes representing ~90% of clinical isolates worldwide. \\n\\nLike the influenza hemagglutinin, the rotavirus VP4 must be cleaved by proteases before the \\nvirus can be activated [8]. Such cleavage results in the generation of two proteins, VP5 and \\nVP8, which remain attached to the virion. Most of the antigenic epitopes in VP4 that induce \\nneutralizing activity have been mapped to VP8, including those responsible for the serotype \\ndifferences among different strains. \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041 PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0 21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 17 \\n\\nFigure 2: Continental Variation in the Distribution of Human Group A Rotavirus P Types \\nAscertained by Analysis of Strains Collected between 1982-2003 \\n\\n[Santos 2005, Rev Med Virol (5)] \\n\\n1.3. Non-replicating Rotavirus Vaccine Approach Using VP8 Subunit \\nThe VP8 subunit of VP4 protein has been expressed in various systems and demonstrated to \\ninduce rotavirus-specific neutralizing antibodies and/or protection in various animal models [9-\\n18]. Monoclonal antibodies to VP8 administered orally are able to confer passive protection in \\nmice [19] and natural rotavirus infection, as well as vaccination with live vaccines, induces \\nprotective anti-VP8 neutralizing antibodies [16]. Mapping of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies \\nagainst VP8 reveals that they recognize linear epitopes in the region between amino acids 64 \\nand 223 of VP8 [13, 20]. All epitopes that induce neutralizing antibody responses to VP8 \\nserotypes P[4], P[6] and P[8] have been mapped to that region [14, 21]), which was selected for \\ninclusion in the proposed P2-VP8 subunit rotavirus vaccine. Recombinant VP8 protein vaccine \\ncandidates have been produced in several systems, including E. coli [13, 18, 22, 23]), \\nlactobacillus [15], yeast [24] and plants [25]. A norovirus particle recombinant fusion protein \\nutilizing a truncated VP8 sequence has also been developed and shown to confer protection \\nagainst rotavirus in a murine challenge model [18]. VP8 produced in E. coli induces high-titered \\nhomotypic neutralizing antibodies in mice, cattle, rabbits, chickens and guinea pigs [12, 13, 23]), \\nas well heterotypic neutralizing antibodies [23]. Passively transmitted antibodies derived from \\nVP8 immunization protected offspring of vaccinated dams [12, 25, 26]. The magnitude and \\nbreadth of the heterotypic neutralizing antibodies induced has been variable and strain \\ndependent. To improve the vaccine potential of the recombinant VP8 subunit protein, we \\nsynthesized a fusion protein comprised of the P2 universal CD4+ T cell epitope (aa 830-844 of \\ntetanus toxin) and a truncated VP8 moiety, which contains all known neutralizing epitopes. The \\nP2 epitope has been employed in the development of various viral and bacterial experimental \\nvaccines including malaria, H. influenza type b and others [27, 28]. \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 18 \\n\\nThe P2-VP8 vaccine to be tested in this study was developed by Dr. Taka Hoshino at NIAID \\n[29]. The monovalent (P[8]) vaccine previously tested consists of bacteria-expressed VP8 \\nsubunit from the Wa strain of human rotaviruses (G1[P8]). A DNA segment encoding the \\nsequence of P2 epitope from tetanus toxin was fused to the VP8 sequence, resulting in this \\nchimeric protein vaccine (P2-VP8). Dr. Hoshino’s laboratory has demonstrated in preclinical \\ntesting that the immunogenicity of these VP8 proteins could be significantly enhanced when \\nfused with the P2 epitope of tetanus toxin, which exerts a strong T cell helper function. Further, \\nimmunization of neonatal piglets with a P2-VP8-P[8] chimeric protein conferred significant \\nprotection against experimental rotavirus gastroenteritis [30]. Based on results of the initial first-\\nin-human testing of the monovalent (P[8]) vaccine (see section 1.7), a trivalent vaccine that \\nincludes antigens from P[4], P[6] and P[8] strains (DS1, 1076 and Wa, respectively) has been \\ndeveloped to broaden responses for these 3 P-types, which together are responsible for the \\nvast majority of global disease burden. The trivalent vaccine will be assessed in this study. \\n\\n1.4. Potential Safety Risks \\nBased on pre-clinical studies, the most commonly expected adverse events are reactions at the \\ninjection site, including redness, swelling and pain; these findings are consistent with reactions \\nseen with licensed vaccines. In addition, as with any vaccine, allergic reactions, including the \\nextremely rare occurrence of life-threatening allergic reactions, cannot be excluded. \\n\\nThe vaccine is to be adsorbed on aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3]. There is a wealth of \\nexperience demonstrating the safety of aluminum salts as an adjuvant, with potential local \\nreactions of erythema, subcutaneous nodules and contact hypersensitivity [31]. \\n\\nSafety data from first-in-human phase 1 testing of the monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 vaccine in \\nadults, toddlers and infants have been reassuring and consistent with anticipated predominantly \\nmild local reactions. (see Section 1.7 for details). \\n\\n1.5. Summary of Nonclinical Studies with Monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 \\nThe safety and immunogenicity of the P2-VP8 subunit vaccine was evaluated in three animal \\nmodels (guinea pigs, Gnotobiotic piglets, and New Zealand White rabbits).

Increased \\nimmunogenicity was assessed in guinea pigs inoculated with either VP8 alone or fused to the \\nP2 epitope [Dr. T. Hoshino, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), \\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH), personal communication]. The sera were tested in a 60% \\nplaque neutralization assay against the homologous strain, which showed that inclusion of a \\nP2 CD4+ T-cell epitope sequence with VP8 enhances the immunogenicity of VP8 by \\nengendering a more rapid rise in neutralizing antibody titers. \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041 PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0 21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 20 \\n\\n1.5.1.2. Evaluation of the Antibody Response in Guinea Pigs Administered Monovalent \\n(P[8]) P2-VP8 with or without Aluminum Phosphate Adjuvant \\n\\nAdsorption of monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit onto aluminum phosphate increases overall \\ntiter and promotes an earlier neutralizing antibody titer compared to monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 \\nsubunit vaccine alone in guinea pigs. High neutralizing antibodies titers were observed for up to \\neight months in animals immunized with 10 or 20 µg monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine \\nadsorbed to aluminum phosphate. \\n\\nAluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3] was selected as the adjuvant for further preclinical and clinical \\ndevelopment based on its success in other clinical trials conducted by PVS with other antigens, \\ncitations in literature that indicate aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3] may have greater adjuvant \\nactivity than aluminum phosphate (27), and availability of clinical-grade material. Similarly, as \\nnoted in Section 1.5.2.3, rabbits immunized with aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3] adjuvanted \\nvaccine in the GLP toxicology study displayed higher anti-P2-VP8 IgG binding antibody levels \\nthan those immunized with non-adjuvanted vaccine. \\n\\n1.5.1.3. Evaluation of the Rotavirus Neutralizing Antibody Response in Guinea Pigs \\nA non-GLP study was conducted in Hartley Guinea Pigs (Elm Hill) to evaluate the magnitude \\nand breadth of the immune response following vaccination with research grade monovalent \\n(P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine, adsorbed to aluminum adjuvant, at Covance (Denver, PA).  \\n\\nFive guinea pigs were immunized with 25 µg monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine \\nadsorbed to aluminum phosphate adjuvant by intramuscular (IM) injection, the planned route of \\nhuman exposure, on Days 0, 30, and 60. Three doses were used to mimic the EPI schedule. \\nSerum was collected for immunological analyses at baseline (Day -7), on Days 0, 30, and 60 \\n(prior to dosing) and at termination on Day 74. Animals were observed daily for viability and \\ngeneral health. \\n\\nWith the exception of a single animal that was found with a broken leg that was subsequently \\neuthanized, no clinical signs were noted throughout the study. \\n\\nRotavirus neutralizing antibodies, which can be directed against either the G (VP7) or P (VP4) \\nantigen expressed by rotavirus, were quantified using a neutralization assay run in a blinded \\nmanner by an independent testing laboratory (M. McNeal, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical \\nCenter, Cincinnati, OH). To analyze the breadth of the immune response, sera were run against \\nsix human strains of rotavirus expressing various combinations of G (1/2/3/4 and 9) and P \\n(4/6/8) genotypes, which have been found to predominate among human field isolates. The \\nresults are shown below in Table 2 and Table 3. Immunization with the monovalent (P[8]) P2-\\nVP8 subunit vaccine elicited a vigorous antibody response to the Wa, P, and WI61 strains, all of \\nwhich displayed the homologous P[8] genotype (Table 2). However, the post-immunization titers \\nto the VA70 strain, which also displays the P[8] genotype were substantially lower. Responses \\nwere meager to the ST3 strain, which has a P[6] genotype; there were intermediate responses \\nto the DS1 strain, which has a P[4] genotype. Overall, immunization resulted in all animals \\nmounting a 4-fold or greater rise in titer over baseline values, regardless of the P genotype \\n(Table 3). \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 21 \\n\\nTable 2: Geometric Mean Neutralizing Titers to Human Rotavirus Strains: Before and \\nAfter Immunization \\n\\nWA P  WI61  ST3 VA70 DS-1  \\n\\n(G1, P[8]) (G3, P[8]) (G9, P[8]) (G4, P[6]) (G4, P[8]) (G2, P[4]) \\n\\nPre Post Pre Post Pre Post Pre Post Pre Post Pre Post \\n\\n5 4,147 5 1,459 5 1,986 5 50 5 233 32 732 \\n\\nTable 3: Seroconversion to Rotavirus Strains Following Immunization * \\nWA P  WI61  ST3 VA70 DS-1  \\n\\n(G1, P[8]) (G3, P[8]) (G9, P[8]) (G4, P[6]) (G4, P[8]) (G2, P[4]) \\n\\n100 100 100 100 100 100 \\n*Values represent the percentage of animals that showed a ≥4-fold \\nrise in titer after immunization. \\n\\nThese data demonstrate that monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine elicits a good \\nheterotypic neutralizing antibody response to strains expressing the P4 but not the P6 genotype. \\nFurthermore, the magnitude of the immune response could vary significantly for strains \\nexpressing the homologous P[8] types, as evidenced by a substantially muted response to \\nstrain VA70.  \\n\\n1.5.1.4. Protection from Rotavirus Disease in Neonatal Piglets \\nThe protective capacity of the P2-VP8 vaccine against a live oral rotavirus challenge was \\nevaluated in a gnotobiotic piglet model. This model is widely viewed as the most rigorous and \\nrelevant animal model for evaluation of rotavirus vaccine efficacy. Three newborn gnotobiotic \\npiglets were immunized via the intramuscular route with three doses of research-grade \\nmonovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine (100 µg per dose) adjuvanted with 600 µg aluminum \\nphosphate, the first given at birth and the subsequent doses at 10-day intervals. An additional \\nnine piglets served as unvaccinated controls. Seven days after the last vaccination, the animals \\nwere challenged with the Wa strain of rotavirus (homologous P[8] serotype) at a dose of 50 \\nTCID50 which consistently induces diarrhea in this model (28).  \\n\\nTiters of P[8] VP4-specific antibodies increased following each vaccination with monovalent \\n(P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine plus aluminum phosphate, with titers first detectable at \\napproximately two weeks following the first vaccination. Titers further increased at 10 days post-\\nchallenge, indicating a boosting effect from natural exposure to a homotypic challenge. \\n\\nTiters of rotavirus-neutralizing antibodies increased significantly by Post-immunization Day \\n(PID) 27, one week following the final vaccination. Titers increased substantially within one \\nweek of homotypic challenge in monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine treated animals \\ncompared to concurrent control animals (Figure 3). \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 22 \\n\\nFigure 3: Rotavirus Geometric Mean Neutralizing Antibody Titers Following \\nVaccination and Challenge  \\n\\n \\n*p < 0.001 \\n\\nShedding of the Wa rotavirus was measured after challenge in control unimmunized gnotobiotic \\npiglets and piglets receiving three inoculations of monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine. \\nVaccination with monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine induced a drop of more than 10-fold \\nin the titer of virus shed in the stools; however, there was no significant difference between the \\nP2-VP8 vaccine and control pig groups. \\n\\nMonovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine significantly reduced post-challenge diarrhea, as \\nestimated by the use of a cumulative, 4-point scoring system (0 points = normal stool \\nconsistency [no diarrhea]; 1 = pasty [mild diarrhea]; 2 = semi liquid [moderate diarrhea]; and 3 = \\nliquid [severe diarrhea]).

This model has also been used to test live oral rotavirus vaccines. These \\nvaccines, though protective, induce diarrhea when administered to gnotobiotic piglets. \\nNumerous field trials evaluating live oral rotavirus vaccines have consistently demonstrated that \\nthey do not prevent infection or substantially reduce mild illness; rather, their protective efficacy \\nis primarily manifested against severe cases of diarrhea. In the piglet study, the monovalent \\n(P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine significantly delayed the onset of diarrhea, significantly reduced \\nthe duration of diarrhea, and significantly reduced the cumulative diarrhea score. These effects \\nmay potentially lead to protection against severe diarrhea in infants, the goal of rotavirus \\nimmunization. \\n\\n1.5.2.

There \\nwere no treatment-related significant differences in food consumption, post-dose body \\ntemperatures, hematology, ophthalmology, or organ weights.  \\n\\nSlightly, but statistically significant, lower creatinine levels were observed on Study Day 3 in females \\ntreated with 60 µg monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine and aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3] \\nadjuvant and on Study Day 8 in females treated with 30 µg monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit \\nvaccine and aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3] or 60 µg monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine with \\nor without aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3]; however, these changes were not considered \\ntoxicologically significant. At Study Day 3 and 8 slight, but statistically significant, increases in \\nfibrinogen were observed in animals treated with 60 µg monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine \\nwith or without aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3] compared to concurrent controls, which is consistent \\nwith inflammatory processes associated with vaccination. At Day 45, all treated animals had \\nsignificantly higher levels of fibrinogen in an apparent dose-related manner, with those animals \\ntreated with aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3] having slightly higher fibrinogen levels at each dose than \\nthose animals treated with monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine alone.  \\n\\nMales and females treated with 60 µg monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine with or without \\naluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3] had statistically significantly higher prothrombin time (PT) at Day \\n3. For groups immunized with vaccine alone, significantly higher PT was observed on Day 8, \\nDay 45 (females only), and Day 85 (females only) compared to concurrent controls. No mean or \\nindividual animal values exceeded the upper limit of the historical range for New Zealand White \\nrabbits at AVANZA Laboratories and animals assigned to the vaccinated groups, particularly \\nGroups 4 & 5, had substantially higher baseline values for PT than control animals, which \\ncontributed to the post-vaccination differences from control observed. \\n\\nWhen PT values were compared to the baseline values for each test group, only females \\ntreated with 60 µg P2-VP8 alone had significant increases over baseline on Day 8 (p = 0.0003). \\nSlight elevations in PT over baseline were observed in animals treated with 60 µg P2-VP8 with \\nor without aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3] on Day 3, although they were not statistically \\nsignificant. Given the modest increases in PT values seen and the temporal nature of any \\nincreases over baseline, these changes were considered to be non-adverse and clinically \\nirrelevant. \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 25 \\n\\nWith the exception of a single female in Group 4 (60 µg monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit \\nvaccine) with subcutaneous red discoloration at the Day 43 injection site on Day 45, there were \\nno gross observations at either necropsy.  \\n\\nTest article-related microscopic findings were limited to the injection sites, and were considered \\nnon-adverse based on minimal to mild severity and apparent reversibility (28). Test article \\neffects associated with monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine plus aluminum hydroxide \\n[Al(OH)3] were minimal to mild accumulations of macrophages with abundant slightly basophilic, \\nfinely granular cytoplasm (termed “foamy macrophages”) in the subcutaneous tissue and/or \\nskeletal muscle interstitium. These macrophages were observed at each injection site (sites 1-4) \\nin one to several animals and are likely related to co-administration of the vaccine with \\naluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3].  \\n\\nMinimal to mild inflammation consisting of a mixture of heterophils and mononuclear \\ninflammatory cells occurred in the dermis or subcutis of animals in all groups, including controls, \\nsuggesting these findings are related to mechanical injury from the injection procedure. A few \\nanimals in each vaccine-treated group had a similar finding in the underlying skeletal muscle.  \\n\\nThe incidence of inflammation was low in all groups at injection sites 1 and 2, indicating a \\nrecovery of acute changes related to vaccination. At injection sites 3 and 4, the incidence of \\ninflammation was slightly higher for groups receiving monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine \\nwith or without aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3]. At injection site 4, the incidence of inflammation \\nwas increased in a dose-related manner, with the highest incidence found in Groups 4 and 5, \\nwhich received 60 µg monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine with or without aluminum \\nhydroxide [Al(OH)3]. All other findings had similar incidence in control and treated groups, and/or \\nwere common spontaneous findings in laboratory rabbits of this age. \\n\\nSix weeks after the final dose (Day 85), test article-related residual foamy macrophages were \\npresent in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue at injection site 3 of one male treated with 60 µg \\nmonovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine plus aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3]. Minimal mixed \\ncell inflammation and minimal to mild hemorrhage also persisted in one or more animals at each \\ninjection site. The incidence of these findings was lower than observed at the terminal sacrifice, \\nindicating resolution was in progress. A delayed-onset change was minimal mineralization in the \\nsubcutaneous tissue at injection site 3 in one male vaccinated with 60 µg monovalent (P[8]) \\nP2-VP8 subunit vaccine plus aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3].

Evaluation of the Antibody Response in Guinea Pigs Administered Either Trivalent \\n\\nor Monovalent P2-VP8 Vaccine \\nTrivalent vaccine was produced by combining the three individual monovalent P2-VP8 vaccines, \\nadsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide, and used to immunize guinea pigs. Animals received three \\ndoses of vaccine at bi-weekly intervals with serum samples taken at baseline and two weeks \\nafter the third dose for determination of IgG binding and rotavirus neutralizing antibodies. \\nImmunization with the individual P2-VP8 proteins evoked not only a robust binding antibody \\nresponse to the homologous antigen but also to the other two vaccine antigens (Table 6). This \\nis not surprising given the level of homology (~65-85%) at the DNA level. In all cases, the GMT \\nafter immunization with the trivalent vaccine was comparable to or slightly higher than that seen \\nwith the individual components, indicating no blunting of the immune response due to antigen \\nload. However, the overall response engendered by the monovalent P2-VP8-P[6] vaccine was \\nlowest both to the homologous P[6] and heterologous P[4] and P[8]antigens. A similar trend was \\nnoted for the neutralizing antibody response (Table 7) where post-immunization titers were \\nlowest to the P[6] vaccine component. While the GMTs for the P[8] and P[6] strains were \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 28 \\n\\ncomparable in groups of animals immunized with either the trivalent or monovalent vaccines, \\nthat for P[4] strain was higher in animals immunized with the monovalent vaccine (338 versus \\n131, respectively). This could be partially attributed to the fact that one animal in the monovalent \\ngroup mounted a very high response (1280) given the relatively small number of animals per \\ngroup (N=6). \\n\\nTable 6:  Serum IgG Binding Antibody Responses in Guinea Pigs following vaccination \\nwith either Monovalent or Trivalent P-VP8 Vaccines. \\n\\nVaccine \\nGroup \\n\\nPost-immunization Geometric Mean Serum IgG Titer (Range) to Vaccine \\nAntigensa  \\n\\nP2-VP8 [P4] P2-VP8 [P6] P2-VP8 [P8] \\nP2-VP8 [P8] 50745 (7190-156777) 13747 (4154-33805) 81534 (7847-287569) \\n\\nP2-VP8 [P6] 31575 (2588-81094) 71363 (10510-175924) 12467 (865-32614) \\n\\nP2-VP8 [P4] 198808 (53675-326972) 22494 (13429-44099) 70988 (28188-112081) \\nTrivalent  \\n\\nP2-VP8 [P8]  \\n+ [P6] + [P4] \\n\\n202245 (152332-281906) 72945 (43079-113257) 131298 (91187-162513) \\n\\na: Animals (groups of 6) were immunized on days 1, 14 and 28 with 30 µg of each antigen.

Study Description \\nSaline control or trivalent P2-VP8 subunit vaccine (180 µg, comprising of 60 µg of the P[8], P[6], \\nand P[4] serotype subunits) with 0.56 mg aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3]) was administered in a \\n0.5 mL volume intramuscularly at 14 day intervals on Study Days 1, 15, 29, and 43, and a \\nunique site (the cranial and caudal aspects of the left and right erector spinae muscle) was used \\nfor each injection. \\n\\nAnimals were observed for dose-site reactogenicity, clinical observations (including \\nophthalmology), body weight changes, food consumption, body temperatures, and clinical \\npathology (hematology, coagulation parameters, and clinical chemistry). Animals were \\nsacrificed two days or 4 weeks following the final dose of vaccine. A full set of tissues were \\nexamined microscopically at two days (Study Day 45) following the final dose of vaccine. \\nInjection sites and underlying muscle tissue were examined four weeks following the final dose \\nof vaccine. \\n\\n1.6.2.2. Toxicology Results \\nVaccination with trivalent P2-VP8 subunit vaccine with aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3] adjuvant \\nwas well-tolerated in NZW rabbits at a dose of 180 µg.  \\n\\nThere were no test-article related clinical observations, including ophthalmology, noted on the \\nstudy. One animal assigned to the vaccine group was noted to have a thin body condition and in \\nappetence, primarily in the recovery phase of the study. Because this finding was consistent with \\nlower food consumption prior to and throughout the study and the animal was able to maintain or \\ngain body weight during the study, this finding was not considered to be related to treatment. \\nDermal site scoring was performed at each dose site for three days following each vaccination. No \\npositive dermal scores were noted for any animals. There were no test article-related effects on \\nbody temperatures. There were slight increases in body temperatures at 6 and 24 hours postdose \\nrelative to predose values for each collection interval; however, these were noted for both control \\nand treated groups. There were no adverse effects on body weights throughout the study, and \\nanimals gained weight. Lower mean food consumption was noted in the vaccine groups; however, \\nthese reduced values were due to a few treated males with consistently low food consumption \\nvalues Due to the low magnitude and lack of correlating clinical observations or decreases group \\nmean body weights, these decreases in food consumption were not considered adverse. \\n\\nThere were no test article-related effects among hematology or clinical chemistry parameters at \\nany interval. All mean and individual values were considered within expected ranges for \\nbiological and/or procedure-related variation despite occasional mean values that reached \\nstatistical significance. Two days following the final vaccination (Day 45), in animals of both \\nsexes receiving the test article, there were minimal decreases in APTT (up to -11%), relative to \\npretest means, minimal increases in fibrinogen (up to +20%) at termination in treated animals of \\nboth sexes, and mild increases in CRP (up to 9.1x), relative to pretest means. All of these \\nfindings were considered test article-related but not adverse; they had generally resolved by the \\nrecovery interval. Furthermore, increases of CRP, while higher than baseline, were still within \\nnormal historical range at MPI Research. These findings were typical of a mild \\nimmune/inflammatory response expected with vaccine administration. All other mean and \\nindividual values were considered within expected ranges for biological variation. \\n\\nThere were no consistent test article-related macroscopic observations or differences in organ \\nweights. All macroscopic findings and organ weight variations were considered to be incidental \\nto test article administration or typical for those seen in rabbits of this sex, strain, and age. Test \\narticle-related microscopic findings were seen only at the injection sites for all groups.

Following a 4-week recovery, there was a strong trend towards recovery in \\nall groups, with generally reduced incidence and severity of most findings compared to terminal \\ngroups. \\n\\n1.6.2.3. Immunogenicity Results \\nThe immunogenicity of the trivalent P2-VP8 subunit rotavirus vaccine was demonstrated in \\nNZW rabbits in the GLP toxicology study. As described above, animals were administered four \\ndoses of 180 µg (60 µg [P8] P2-VP8 + 60 µg [P6] P2-VP8 + 60 µg [P4] P2-VP8) subunit vaccine \\nadsorbed to aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3] adjuvant on Study Days 1, 15, 29, and 43. Serum \\nsamples for immunological analyses were collected at baseline and two days following the final \\nvaccination on Study Day 45. \\n\\nAt baseline, some animals in the control and vaccine groups had low, but detectable, titers to \\none or more of the P2-VP8 constructs. This may be the result of subclinical rotavirus infections \\nin these animals or due to non-specific binding in the assay. The titers are several-fold lower \\nthan those observed in the treated group post-vaccination. \\n\\nAll animals vaccinated with trivalent P2-VP8 had substantial titers to all three serotypes on Day \\n45, as shown in the table, below.

The trial was a double-blinded, \\nrandomized, placebo-controlled dose-escalation study, in which study volunteers were \\nrandomized into three dose level cohorts of 16 individuals (12 vaccine recipients and 4 placebo \\nrecipients). Participants in each cohort received three intramuscular injections four weeks apart \\nof one of three dose levels of vaccine (10 µg, 30 µg and 60 µg) or placebo (saline).  \\n\\nOverall, the vaccine was well-tolerated at all three dose levels, was associated with only mild \\ntransient local reactogenicity, and no safety concerns were identified. Thirty-four of the \\n36 volunteers allocated to receive vaccine received all 3 injections (11/12 in the 10 µg cohort, \\n11/12 in the 30 µg cohort and 12/12 in the 60 µg cohort (10/12 placebo recipients received all \\n3 vaccines).

Clinical testing of monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine in toddlers and \\ninfants in South Africa (VAC 013) \\n\\nClinical testing of the monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit rotavirus vaccine was initiated in South \\nAfrican toddlers and infants in 2014, and that trial is now fully enrolled. Preliminary primary \\nsafety and immunogenicity results are available and presented below. The trial is a double-\\nblind, randomized, placebo-controlled dose-escalation study. Dose escalation, from 10 to 30 to \\n60 µg, was first performed in small groups of toddlers (12 vaccine and 2 placebo recipients per \\ndose level), before initiation of similar dose escalation in 6-8 week old infants (12 vaccine and 4 \\nplacebo recipients per dose level). The two highest tolerated doses, 30 and 60 µg, were \\nselected for expanded testing in infants, with simultaneous randomization to each of the two \\ndoses or placebo (38 infants in each of the three arms). EPI vaccines, excluding oral rotavirus \\nvaccine, were co-administered with the three study vaccines in infants (at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of \\nage). \\n\\nThe vaccine has been generally well-tolerated at all three dose levels. The data presented in \\nTables 17 and 18, for local and systemic reactogenicity are complete, and the data presented \\nfor adverse events in Table 19 represent the available data through 28 days after the last \\nvaccination of all participants. The data are presented by age-group and dose level. In both \\ntoddlers and infants, when local reactogenicity was reported, it was transient, rarely greater than \\nmild, and never severe (Table 17). When present, systemic reactogenicity was also transient \\nand generally mild, without discernable dose effect (Table 18). Late in the expanded infant \\ncohort experience, two participants were reported to have severe irritability following one of their \\nthree study injections (co-administered with EPI vaccinations), one of whom received placebo. \\nThese events occurred after the second dose in one participant and third in the other, and were \\nbrief and transient (≤24 hours at the severe intensity level in both cases, completely resolved in \\none day in one participant and within 3 days in the other).  \\n\\nIn the dose-escalation phase of the testing in the infant cohorts, the study injections were \\npaused temporarily due to findings of severe neutropenia on post-vaccination laboratory \\nmonitoring in three participants (two infants and one toddler). The Safety Review Committee \\n(SRC, composed of the principal investigator, Emmes medical monitor, PATH medical officer \\nand two, independent local experts) interpretation of the review of the baseline screening data \\n(including data for those who were screened-out), unblinded aggregate data for neutrophil \\ncounts at the scheduled 7 day post-vaccination time point, the changes relative to baseline, and \\nthe unblinded allocation of the three participants with severe neutropenia was that the data did \\nnot indicate a relationship to receipt of the study vaccine, and study injections were resumed. \\n \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 37 \\n\\nTable 17:  Maximum Injection Site Reactogenicity per Participant in VAC 013 \\n\\nSeverity \\n\\nPain/ \\nTenderness \\n\\nN (%) \\n\\nErythema/ \\nRedness \\n\\nN (%) \\n\\nInduration/ \\nSwelling \\n\\nN (%) \\nItching \\nN (%) \\n\\nCohort A, 10µg \\n\\nNone 11 (91.7) 12 (100.0) 12 (100.0) 11 (91.7) \\n\\nMild 1 (8.3) 0 0 0 \\n\\nModerate 0 0 0 1 (8.3) \\n\\nSevere 0 0 0 0 \\n\\nCohort A, 30µg \\n\\nNone 8 (66.7) 11 (91.7) 11 (91.7) 9 (75.0) \\n\\nMild 4 (33.3) 0 1 (8.3) 3 (25.0) \\n\\nModerate 0 1 (8.3) 0 0 \\n\\nSevere 0 0 0 0 \\n\\nCohort A, 60µg \\n\\nNone 10 (83.3) 11 (91.7) 12 (100.0) 12 (100.0) \\n\\nMild 2 (16.7) 1 (8.3) 0 0 \\n\\nModerate 0 0 0 0 \\n\\nSevere 0 0 0 0 \\n\\nCohort A, Placebo \\n\\nNone 5 (83.3) 6 (100.0) 6 (100.0) 6 (100.0) \\n\\nMild 1 (16.7) 0 0 0 \\n\\nModerate 0 0 0 0 \\n\\nSevere 0 0 0 0 \\n\\nCohort B1, 10µg \\n\\nNone 7 (58.3) 8 (66.7) 8 (66.7) 10 (83.3) \\n\\nMild 5 (41.7) 4 (33.3) 4 (33.3) 2 (16.7) \\n\\nModerate 0 0 0 0 \\n\\nSevere 0 0 0 0 \\n\\nCohort B1, 30µg \\n\\nNone 5 (41.7) 9 (75.0) 8 (66.7) 12 (100.0) \\n\\nMild 6 (50.0) 3 (25.0) 4 (33.3) 0 \\n\\nModerate 1 (8.3) 0 0 0 \\n\\nSevere 0 0 0 0 \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nTable 17:  Maximum Injection Site Reactogenicity per Participant in VAC 013 (cont’d) \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 38 \\n\\nSeverity \\n\\nPain/ \\nTenderness \\n\\nN (%) \\n\\nErythema/ \\nRedness \\n\\nN (%) \\n\\nInduration/ \\nSwelling \\n\\nN (%) \\nItching \\nN (%) \\n\\nCohort B1, 60µg \\n\\nNone 2 (16.7) 8 (66.7) 9 (75.0) 9 (75.0) \\n\\nMild 8 (66.7) 4 (33.3) 3 (25.0) 3 (25.0) \\n\\nModerate 2 (16.7) 0 0 0 \\n\\nSevere 0 0 0 0 \\n\\nPot.

HYPOTHESIS, SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE, OBJECTIVES AND STUDY DESIGN \\n2.1. Study Hypothesis \\nPrimary Hypotheses:  \\nSafety \\nThe trivalent P2-VP8 subunit rotavirus vaccine is safe and well-tolerated in healthy South \\nAfrican adults, toddlers and infants. \\n\\nImmunogenicity \\nThe trivalent P2-VP8 subunit rotavirus vaccine is immunogenic in healthy South African infants \\nand will induce neutralizing immune responses to at least 2 of the 3 strains from which vaccine \\nantigens are derived in 60% or more of participants in at least one of the study groups. \\n\\n2.2. Scientific Rationale  \\nLive oral rotavirus vaccines have not performed optimally in developing-country populations. The \\ndiscrepancy in performance of these vaccines in developed versus developing countries is not a \\nunique feature of rotavirus vaccines; it has also been observed with other oral, live attenuated \\nenteric vaccines, such as those targeted against cholera and poliomyelitis, for which efficacy is \\ndiminished in resource poor countries. Strategies targeting the development of inactivated \\nrotavirus vaccines have recently been proposed [3], which are supported by the successful use of \\nparenteral vaccines to control disease caused by several orally transmitted pathogens including \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 43 \\n\\npoliovirus, Vibrio cholera and Salmonella typhi. Most approaches for developing inactivated \\nrotavirus vaccines have focused on eliciting rotavirus neutralizing antibodies directed at either the \\nVP4 or VP7 rotavirus neutralizing antigens. Several direct and indirect observations support the \\npossibility that parenterally-administered, non-replicating rotavirus vaccines will likely be \\nsuccessful, including observations derived from natural rotavirus infection studies in infants, \\nrotavirus challenge studies in adult volunteers, human rotavirus vaccine trials, and animal \\nrotavirus vaccine studies. The induction of non-neutralizing antibody responses may result in \\nmucosal protection, either through the induction of local IgA responses or, more likely, through \\n“leaking” into the gut of IgG antibodies generated by adjuvanted parenteral injection of non-\\nreplicating vaccines. This possibility is supported by the finding that high titers of circulating anti-\\nrotavirus IgG are transmitted trans-placentally in humans. Maternally derived IgG antibody \\nappears to modulate vaccine takes and be protective against early rotavirus disease, and \\npassively administered antibody may prevent or diminish disease [32, 33]. \\n\\nClinical testing of the monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine has demonstrated the vaccine \\nto be well-tolerated, without safety signals. In adults, neutralizing antibody results against P[8] \\nstrains were promising, but less so against P[4] strains and disappointing against P[6] strains. \\nTherefore, a trivalent vaccine, comprising antigens from all 3 strains has been developed to \\noptimize responses against all three strains, which together are responsible for the vast majority \\nof global disease burden. Preclinical testing indicates improved responses to P[4] and P[6] with \\nthe trivalent vaccine. \\n\\nThe dose levels to be assessed in this protocol are based on results in infants in VAC 013 (see \\nsection 1.7.2), in which the 60 µg dose did not seem to provide any better responses in terms of \\nimmune response or impact on Rotarix shedding, compared to the 30 µg dose. The highest \\ndose to be assessed in this protocol is an aggregated dose of 90 µg, composed of 30 µg of \\neach of the three antigens.  \\n\\nFurther, as in VAC 013, the impact of the trivalent vaccine on the replication of Rotarix, which \\nwill be administered to the infants after completion of the 3-dose regimen of P2-VP8, will be \\nassessed. Impact on shedding of Rotarix will be interpreted as a surrogate of protection. This \\nassessment will provide an indication of whether the addition of two more antigens alters the \\nimpact observed in VAC 013 with the monovalent vaccine. \\n\\n2.3. Overall Clinical Development Strategy \\nThe ultimate goal of the P2-VP8 subunit rotavirus vaccine clinical development plan is to \\ndemonstrate the safety and efficacy of this vaccine approach in a series of studies to gain \\nsufficient information to achieve both local registration of the vaccine in the country(ies) where \\nthe pivotal trials will be conducted and prequalification by WHO to support product acquisition \\nby GAVI, UNICEF or others for distribution, in general, to low income countries. Briefly, the \\noverall clinical development plan consists of: 1) the first in human phase 1 safety trial of the \\nmonovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine performed in the US in 2013; 2) the phase 1-2 \\ndescending age safety and immunogenicity trial of the monovalent (P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit \\nvaccine in toddlers and infants currently approaching completion in South Africa; 3) the \\nproposed phase 1-2 descending age safety and immunogenicity trial of the trivalent (P[4], P[6] \\nand P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine in adults, toddlers and infants in South Africa; and 4) phase 3 \\nefficacy trials to evaluate efficacy of the trivalent P2-VP8 subunit vaccine against severe \\nrotavirus diarrhea. Additional clinical trial assessments could include: clinical assessment of lot-\\nto-lot consistency (potentially could be combined with the efficacy trials); assessment of \\ninterference of the vaccine with the immune responses to routine EPI vaccinations; and \\nassessment of vaccine safety and immunogenicity in other populations.  \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 44 \\n\\n2.4. Study Design \\nThe trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled dose-escalation study in which two \\ndose-levels (30 µg and 90 µg) of vaccine will be tested in adults and toddlers and then three \\ndose-levels will be assessed in infants (15 µg, 30 µg and 90 µg). In Group A, cohorts of 15 \\nadults (12 vaccine and 3 placebo recipients) per dose level will receive three study injections at \\n4 week intervals (consistent with the regimen in the adult study of the monovalent vaccine), \\nadvancing from the first to the second dose-level after assessment of safety data through the \\nfirst week after the first injection (A1). Based on the safety data in the adult group, Group B \\ncohorts of 15 toddlers (12 vaccine recipients and 3 placebo recipients) per dose level will \\nreceive a single intramuscular injection (consistent with the regimen administered to toddlers in \\nthe current study of the monovalent vaccine in toddlers), advancing from the first to the second \\ndose-level after assessment of safety data through the first week after the injection in the lower \\ndose toddler group (B1) and all available data for the adult group. Based on the safety data in \\nthe toddler cohorts, Group C cohorts of 16 infants (12 vaccine recipients and 4 placebo \\nrecipients) per dose level will receive three study injections at 4 week intervals (concomitant \\nwith EPI vaccinations, with the exception of rotavirus vaccination), starting at ≥6 and <8 weeks \\nof age. Advancing from the first to the second dose-level in Group C will occur after assessment \\nof safety data through the first week after the first injection (C1), as well as all available data for \\ntoddlers and adults. Advancing from the second to the third dose-level (90 µg) in Group C will \\noccur after assessment of safety data through the first week after the first injection of the second \\ndose-level (30 µg). If all three dose levels are tolerated in the infant dose-escalation phase (Part \\nC), they will be assessed in an expanded infant cohort (Group D) of 552 infants (138 at each \\ndose level and 138 placebo recipients). All infants will receive Rotarix at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after \\nthe third study injection (study Days 84, 112 and 140), and fecal shedding of Rotarix will be \\nassessed during the week after the first dose in a subset of infants. Three doses of Rotarix are \\nto be administered rather than two to counterbalance the remote theoretical possibility that the \\nP2-VP8 subunit vaccine could reduce response to Rotarix. \\n\\n2.4.1.

Product Description \\nThe P2-VP8 subunit rotavirus vaccine is made by inserting a codon optimized synthetic gene \\nencoding the VP8 region of rotavirus VP4 fused to the P2 T-cell epitope coding sequence of \\ntetanus toxin into the Pj411 proprietary cloning vector developed by DNA 2.0, Menlo Park, CA. \\nThe vector carries a kanamycin resistance gene as a selection marker. The vector was \\ntransfected into the BL21 strain of E. coli. The fusion protein is purified from Isopropyl β-D-1-\\nthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-induced and physically lysed cultures using standard column \\nchromatographic techniques employing Q-Sepharose and Butyl 650 as resins in addition to \\nultrafiltration and diafiltration. The purified protein is co-formulated with aluminum hydroxide \\n[Al(OH)3] (see Section 3.3). \\n\\n3.2. Products and Manufacturers \\nTrivalent P2-VP8 subunit rotavirus vaccine is manufactured and supplied by the Walter Reed \\nArmy Institute of Research (WRAIR) Pilot Bioproduction Facility (BPF).  \\n\\nSterile aluminum hydroxide adjuvant Lot Nr 1862 (2 mg of aluminum per mL) was prepared, \\nlabeled and sampled for QC release at WRAIR and will be used as a diluent to prepare the 60 \\nµg vaccine dose. The vials were stored at 2-8°C at WRAIR. \\n\\nSodium Chloride 0.9%, USP for Injection will be used to dilute the active P2-VP8 vaccine to final \\ndosing concentration and will be used for the placebo for the study. The research pharmacy at \\neach site will obtain enough supply of the same lot of Sodium Chloride 0.9% for Injection, USP \\nfrom Pharma Logistical Solutions (Pty) Ltd to complete the study.  \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 47 \\n\\n3.3. Presentation and Formulation \\nThe trivalent P2-VP8 vaccine is formulated as a sterile suspension containing a total of 360 µg \\nof protein (120 µg of each P type) per mL adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide (1.125 mg of \\naluminum per mL in a phosphate buffer, pH 7). The vaccine is contained within a 2 mL \\nborosilicate glass vial sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and a crimped metal collar. The \\nvaccine is stored at 2-8°C. To produce the 15, 30 and 90 µg doses (containing 5, 10 and 30 µg \\nof each P2-VP8 vaccine component, respectively), the vaccine is diluted with the aluminum \\nhydroxide adjuvant diluent within 6 hours of administration (aluminum hydroxide diluted to a \\nconcentration of 1.125 mg/mL before being used to dilute the vaccine).  \\n\\nThe doses of the trivalent P2-VP8 subunit vaccine will be prepared in the pharmacy. Blinded \\nstudy syringes will be prepared for the study coordinator for administration to the volunteers. \\n\\n3.4. Stability and Storage \\nThe trivalent P2-VP8 subunit vaccine is stored at 2-8°C until used. A pilot lot of vaccine has \\nbeen shown to be stable when stored for 6 months at 2-8°C (study ongoing). The P2-VP8 \\ntrivalent vaccine to be used in this study (Lot Nr 1917) is being monitored for stability at 2-8°C \\nper ICH guidelines. The vaccine has been shown to be stable for 3 months (latest time point \\navailable). Stability will be evaluated for a minimum of 24 months. The aluminum hydroxide \\nadjuvant (Lot Nr 1862) to be used as a diluent to prepare the 60 µg dose of vaccine has been \\nshown to be stable for 6 months when stored at 2-8°C. Stability studies are ongoing and will be \\nconducted for a minimum of 24 months. Sodium chloride 0.9% for Injection, USP, will be used to \\nprepare the aluminum hydroxide diluent. These 10 mL vials will be stored at room temperature. \\n\\n3.5. Preparation and Administration \\nIn Groups A and B, at each dose level 12 participants will be randomized to receive vaccine and \\nthree (3) to receive placebo; in Group C, at each dose level 12 participants will be randomized \\nto receive vaccine and four (4) to receive placebo.

STUDY POPULATION \\n4.1. Clinical Trial Sites \\nThis study is a multisite clinical trial, to be performed in South Africa at the Family Clinical \\nResearch Unit (FAM-CRU) at Tygerberg Children’s Hospital, the Respiratory and Meningeal \\nPathogens Research Unit (RMPRU) in Soweto, and the Shandukani Research Centre in \\nHillbrow, Johannesburg. The study population will be recruited, screened and qualified by site \\nstaff under the direction of the PIs at each site. \\n\\n4.2. Study Population \\nThe study population will consist of healthy adults, toddlers and infants from the communities in \\nthe vicinity of the study clinics. Adult participants and parents of toddler and infant participants \\nwill be fully informed about the study, after which they will provide consent for participation. \\n\\n4.3. Eligibility \\nParticipants will be in general good health: in the adult group, participants will be >18 and <45 \\nyears of age; in the toddler cohort, participants will be >2 and <3 years of age; and in the infant \\ncohorts will be >6 and <8 weeks old, at the time of enrollment. Potential volunteer families of \\ninfants may be contacted from before the babies are born through the noted targeted age. Final \\neligibility determination will depend on the results of the medical history, clinical examination, \\nscreening laboratory tests and fulfillment of all the inclusion and absence of any of the exclusion \\ncriteria, and appropriate understanding of the study and completion of the consent process by \\nadult participants and parents of toddler and infant participants. \\n\\nInvestigators should always use good clinical judgment in considering a participant’s overall \\nfitness for inclusion in the trial. Some participants may not be appropriate for the study, even if \\nthey meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria. For instance, medical, occupational or other conditions \\npresent in the parents may make safety evaluations difficult or make toddlers and infants poor \\ncandidates for retention. All toddlers and infants targeted for enrollment will need to have \\nparents that can comprehend the purpose of the study and provide written informed consent. In \\naddition, the adult participants and families of toddler and infant participants should be resident \\nin the area without plans to leave the study site during the course of the study. \\n\\nA sufficient number of healthy adults, toddlers and infants will be screened, with consent, to \\nenroll 30 adults, 30 toddlers and 600 infants in the study.  \\n\\n4.4.

STUDY PROCEDURES \\n5.1. Recruitment  \\nAdults will be invited for screening by means of advertisements in the local community. All \\nadvertisements will be approved the Ethics Committee before implementation. \\n\\nToddlers will be identified from hospital birth registers. The parent will be contacted and invited \\nto bring the child to RMPRU for screening. \\n\\nInfants will be identified in the postnatal wards at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital after \\ndelivery, and the mother will be invited to bring her infant to the RMPRU prior to the first clinic \\nvisit for screening and potential enrolment. \\n\\nAt FAMCRU, in Tygerberg, pregnant women will be informed of the study at the Kraaifontein \\nMidwife obstetric unit’s antenatal clinic. Those interested will then be followed up for delivery at \\nthe midwife obstetric unit. Potential participants will also be identified at the Tygerberg hospital \\nantenatal clinic and followed up at the labour ward of Tygerberg hospital with delivery of the \\ninfant.  \\n\\nAt the Shandukani Research Centre, pregnant women at antenatal clinics and mothers of \\ninfants attending the Day 3 visit will be approached. Recruitment activity will also occur at \\nsurrounding City of Johannesburg Region F clinics. The study will be discussed with the \\nparents, and, if they agree, permission will be obtained to collect their names and contact \\ndetails. Closer to the potential enrollment date, parents will be contacted and invited to visit the \\nShandukani Research Centre. At that time interested parents will be also asked not to give their \\ninfants the 6 week Rotarix vaccine. Recruitment activity will also occur at the 6 week EPI \\nvaccination visit. The site will develop a study-specific pamphlet for parents considering \\nparticipation in the study.  \\n\\n5.2. Screening, Randomization, and Masking Procedures (for all age-groups) \\n5.2.1. Initial and Continuing Informed Consent  \\nInformed consent is the process of ensuring that study participants, or, in the case of toddlers \\nand infants, their parents, fully understand the purpose of the study and what will and may \\nhappen to them/their children while participating in a research study. Initial written informed \\nconsent is required before performance of any study-related procedures. The informed consent \\nprocess continues throughout the study. Key study concepts are reviewed with the study \\nparticipants/participants’ parents at designated times and as needed, and the review is \\ndocumented. Additionally, if any new information becomes available that, in the judgment of \\nPVS and/or PIs, may affect the participants’/parents’ decision to continue in the trial, such \\ninformation will be shared with the participants/parents, and they may be asked to sign a new \\nconsent form. \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 52 \\n\\n5.2.2. Screening – Day -7 (infants) or Day -28 (adults and toddlers) to Day -1 \\nAfter the site PI or designee has obtained informed consent from participants/parents, the \\nfollowing procedures will be completed during screening to determine study eligibility and may \\noccur over multiple screening visits. Additional screening visits may be scheduled for any follow \\nup as needed, but are not required. At the screening visit(s), the site PI or designee will provide \\nprospective participants (adults) and parents of prospective participants (toddlers and infants) a \\ndetailed description of the study objectives and study participation requirements, as well as \\npotential health risks and benefits associated with study participation. Baseline data are \\nobtained during screening, which may occur over the course of several contacts/visits, between \\n7 days prior to and on Day 0, the day of first injection for infants and from 28 days prior to Day 0 \\nfor toddlers and adults. All inclusion/exclusion criteria must be assessed from data obtained \\nwithin that period, unless otherwise specified in the eligibility criteria. After study information has \\nbeen provided and the appropriate informed consent has been obtained, the following \\nprocedures are performed before enrollment: \\n\\na) Confirm written informed consent has been obtained and solicit/discuss any remaining \\nquestions the participant/parent may have; \\n\\nb) Assign participant ID once study specific consent form has been signed; \\nc) Obtain demographic and contact (e.g., address, telephone, email) information; \\nd) Obtain medical history; \\ne) Obtain vaccination history for toddlers and infants (for adults, vaccination history for past \\n\\n30 days); \\nf) Obtain history of medication use in the past 30 days; \\ng) Measure height/length & weight; \\nh) Perform full physical exam (including vital signs); and \\ni) Collect blood samples for screening laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) \\n\\n(including WBC, hemoglobin, platelet count), alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin, \\nalbumin (obtained only at screening) and creatinine (Appendix I).* Serum pregnancy test \\nwill be performed on women of childbearing potential. \\n\\na. For adults toddlers, HIV ELISA \\n\\nb. For infants, HIV PCR (unless mother has negative test result between 24 weeks \\ngestation and screening)  \\n\\nj) Collect blood samples for immunological testing.  \\n\\n* Grade 1 laboratory abnormalities will not be considered to be exclusionary at screening, \\nunless judged to be clinically significant by the site PI. \\n\\n5.2.3. Randomization  \\nEnrollment will be performed online using the enrollment module of AdvantageEDCSM, the \\nEmmes Corporation’s electronic data capture system. Randomization will occur on the day \\nparticipants are to receive their first study injection, after confirmation of eligibility and \\nimmediately prior to injection.  \\n\\nParticipants will be assigned to a coded treatment assignment after demographic and eligibility \\ndata have been entered into the system. The unblinded research pharmacist will be provided \\nwith the treatment assignment codes for preparation of the vaccine or placebo to be given to \\neach participant. The unblinded research pharmacist will maintain the treatment code list in a \\nsecure place. \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 53 \\n\\n5.2.4.

If clinically significant abnormalities are \\nidentified during screening, participants will be referred to their primary health provider or \\nappropriate medical center. If identified during the study, participants may be asked to return to \\nthe study clinic for further evaluation, including clinical evaluation and repeat or additional \\nlaboratory testing, as warranted. \\n\\nAt the discretion of PVS, GCLP audits may be conducted to ascertain adequate processing of \\nimmunogenicity specimens. \\n\\n6.3. Immunological assays  \\nThe immunological assays to be performed include: \\n\\n• Antibody (IgG & IgA by ELISA) to P2-VP8 analysis on sera from the screening visit and \\nDays 56, 84 and 140 in the infant groups, the screening visit and Day 28 in the toddler \\ngroup, and the screening visit and 28 days after each study injection in the adult group. \\nMagnitude (GMTs) of the ELISA IgG and IgA titers will be determined in serum samples \\nfor each of these time points; frequency of seroresponse rate will be determined for each \\npost-study injection time point. Magnitude (GMTs) of the ELISA IgG and IgA will be \\ndetermined 28 days after the second dose of Rotarix in the infant cohort (Day 140). \\n\\n• Rotavirus neutralization analysis on sera from the screening visit and Days 56, 84 and \\n140 in the infant groups, the screening visit and Day 28 in the toddler group, and the \\nscreening visit and 28 days after each study injection in the adult group. Neutralization \\nassays against the strains from which the vaccine was based will be conducted. \\nNeutralization against several divergent rotavirus strains will be assessed if homologous \\nneutralization is detected. \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 69 \\n\\n• Anti-rotavirus IgA (whole viral lysate) by ELISA will be determined in serum samples \\ncollected at baseline and one month after the final study injection. \\n\\n• Additional immunogenicity assays may be performed by research laboratories to further \\nevaluate post-study injection immune responses and to explore whether correlates of \\nprotection may be identified. \\n\\n6.4. Assay qualification, standardization and validation  \\nSerum anti-rotavirus IgA by ELISA (to whole viral lysate) and neutralizing antibody responses \\nwill be assessed in validated assays. Anti-P2-VP8 IgA and IgG by ELISA will be assessed in \\nqualified assays. \\n\\n6.5. Stool testing for rotavirus \\nDiagnosis of rotavirus infection in infants experiencing diarrhea during the study will be \\ndetermined by stool detection of rotavirus using a validated antigen detection assay by ELISA at \\nNICD. ELISA positive specimens will be confirmed and genotyped by PCR amplification of the \\nVP7 and VP4 genes with a panel of G- and P-specific primers, respectively (WHO Manual of \\nrotavirus detection and characterization methods, Methods 14 and 15 with minor modifications). \\nThe primer sets include: G-specific primer set (Beg9, End9, aAT8v, aBT1, aCT2, aDT4, mG3, \\nmG9, mG10, mG12b and EndA) for the detection of G1, G2, G3, G4, G8, G9, G10 and G12 \\nrotavirus strains and P-specific primer set (con2, con3, 1T-1v, 2T-1, 3T-1, 4T-1, 5T-1, mP11, \\np4943 and VP4F) for the detection of P[4], P[6], P[8], P[9], P[10], P[11] and P[14] rotavirus \\nstrains. Where the genotype cannot be obtained using the G or P-specific primers, sequencing \\nof the VP7 or VP4 genes will be performed. \\n\\n6.6. Rotarix shedding \\nAt one study site, RMPRU, stool samples will be obtained 5, 7 and 9 days following the first \\ndose of Rotarix for qualitative assessment of vaccine virus shedding at NICD. \\n\\nAll stool samples will be tested for the presence of rotavirus using the commercially available \\nProsPecT™ Rotavirus Microplate Assay (Oxoid Ltd, Ely, United Kingdom), according to the \\nmanufacturer’s instructions.  \\n\\nELISA positive specimens may be confirmed and genotyped by PCR amplification of the VP7 \\nand VP4 genes with a panel of G- and P-specific primers, respectively (WHO Manual of \\nrotavirus detection and characterization methods, Methods 14 and 15 with minor modifications). \\nThe primer sets include: G-specific primer set (Beg9, End9, aAT8v, aBT1, aCT2, aDT4, mG3, \\nmG9, mG10, mG12b and EndA) for the detection of G1, G2, G3, G4, G8, G9, G10 and G12 \\nrotavirus strains and P-specific primer set (con2, con3, 1T-1v, 2T-1, 3T-1, 4T-1, 5T-1, mP11, \\np4943 and VP4F) for the detection of P[4], P[6], P[8], P[9], P[10], P[11] and P[14] rotavirus \\nstrains. Genotype G1 and/or P[8] rotavirus strains will be sequenced to determine if the strain is \\nvaccine derived or a wild-type case. The VP7 (1062bp) and VP4 (876 bp) genes amplified by \\nPCR will be purified and sequenced using the BigDye® Terminator v 3.1 cycle sequencing kits \\n(Applied Biosystems). Reactions will be run on a 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) \\nand data analyzed with manufacturer supplied software. Sequences will be directly compared to \\nthe VP7 and VP4 genes of the Rotarix strains (sequences available on Genbank; JN849114.1 \\nVP7 and JN849113.1 VP4) and submitted to GenBank for BLASTn analyses to establish \\nwhether the VP7 and VP4 genes are from the vaccine or from wild-type G1P[8] strains. \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 70 \\n\\n6.7.

STATISTICAL DESIGN AND ANALYSIS \\n7.1. Overview and General Design  \\nThis study is a Phase 1/2 randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation, descending age clinical \\ntrial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the trivalent rotavirus P2-VP8 subunit rotavirus \\nvaccine (adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3]) as compared to a placebo (NS). The \\nprimary objectives are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the P2-VP8 \\nsubunit rotavirus vaccine with Al(OH)3 in infants. Immunogenicity is to be assessed through \\ndetection of vaccine-specific anti-P2-VP8 IgG and IgA antibodies by ELISA (to the P[4], P[6] and \\nP[8] antigens in the vaccine) and neutralization of both homologous (the three strains from \\nwhich the vaccine antigens are derived) and heterologous rotavirus strains.  \\n\\nThe primary hypothesis of safety will be fulfilled if no participants develop a vaccine related SAE \\nand the vaccine is well-tolerated.  \\n\\nThe second hypothesis of immunogenicity will be fulfilled if at least 60% of the infants in at least \\none dose level demonstrate neutralizing responses to at least two of three strains from which \\nthe vaccine antigens are derived. \\n\\nA detailed statistical analysis plan for preparation of the final study report will be created and \\nmade final prior to database lock and unblinding for each age group. All statistical analyses will \\nbe performed using SAS® software Version 9.2 or later. \\n\\nMedical history and AEs will be coded using MedDRA dictionary Version 16.1 or later. The \\nfrequency count and percentage of participants will be summarized according to the coded \\nterms of system organ class and preferred term. Participant-wise data listings will be provided. \\n\\n7.2. Randomization and blinding procedures \\nThe randomization scheme will be generated and maintained by the Statistical and Data \\nManagement Group (SDMG) at The Emmes Corporation, Rockville, MD. Participants will be \\nenrolled into the study cohorts online and randomized using the enrollment module of The \\nEmmes Corporation’s AdvantageEDCSM electronic data capture system. Each participant \\nenrolled into the trial will be assigned a treatment code based on the cohort he/she is enrolled \\ninto after demographic and eligibility data have been entered into the system. \\n\\nThe site pharmacists with primary responsibility for dispensing study products are charged with \\nmaintaining security of the treatment assignments.  \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 71 \\n\\n7.3.

For the two infant cohorts combined (C and \\nD), with 150 vaccine recipients per dose group and 450 vaccine recipients for the three dose \\ngroups combined will provide a greater than 90% chance of observing an AE that has a 1.6% \\nand 0.5% rate of occurrence, respectively. \\n\\nConversely, if no SAEs are observed in 24 and 450 vaccine recipients, the study will be able to \\nrule out SAEs occurring at a rate of approximately 11.7% and 0.7%, respectively based on the \\nupper bounds of the one-sided 95% confidence. \\n\\n  \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 74 \\n\\nTable 25:  Probabilities of observing AEs \\n\\nCohort  Sample Size Underlying Event Rate \\nProbability to \\nobserve an AE \\n\\nA (Adults) \\n \\n\\nOR \\n \\n\\nB (toddlers) \\n\\nEach Dose \\nGroup 12 \\n\\n1.0% 11% \\n2.0% 22% \\n5.0% 46% \\n17.5% 90% \\n\\nBoth Doses \\nCombined 24 \\n\\n1.0% 21% \\n2.0% 38% \\n5.0% 71% \\n6.2% 90% \\n\\nC+D (Infants) \\n\\nEach Dose \\nGroup 150 \\n\\n1.0% 78% \\n1.6% 91% \\n2.0% 95% \\n5.0% >99% \\n\\nAll 3 Doses \\nCombined 450 \\n\\n0.2% 59% \\n0.3% 74% \\n0.4% 84% \\n2.0% 90% \\n\\n \\n\\n7.4.2. Primary Immunogenicity Endpoints \\nBased on the results in South African infants who received monovalent P2-VP8 vaccine or \\nplacebo (VAC-013), the strain specific seroresponse rates for both P2-VP8 vaccine doses are \\nexpected to be ≥80% for at least one of the three P2-VP8 vaccine doses and <20% for the \\nplacebo group. For the two infant cohorts combined with 135 evaluable vaccine recipients per \\ndose level (assuming 10% loss), this study is designed to provide at least 74% and 95% power \\n(Fisher’s exact test) to detect 15 and 20 percentage points difference (e.g. 65% vs. 80 and 60% \\nvs. 80%%), respectively, in seroresponse rates between any two P2-VP8 dose groups. For \\ncomparisons between a P2-VP8 dose group and the combined placebo groups, this study is \\ndesigned to provide ≥99% power to detect ≥30 percentage point difference (e.g. 50% vs. 20%). \\n\\nFor the sample calculations of the Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) endpoint based on the (VAC \\n013 study, the LOG10 standard deviations were estimated to be <0.6 (range: 0.24 – 0.56) for \\nthe P2-VP8 doses and the placebo group. Using a conservative LOG10 standard deviation of \\n0.6, this study with 135 evaluable infants per group (assuming 10% loss) is designed to provide \\nat least 98% power to detect as low as a 2.0-fold difference between any two P2-VP8 dose \\ngroups or between any P2-VP8 vaccine dose (15 µg, 30 µg or 90 µg dose) and the placebo \\ngroup. \\n\\n  \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 75 \\n\\nTable 26:  Power calculations for Comparing GMT in Two Groups of Infants (Cohorts C \\nand D combined) \\n\\nLOG10 Standard \\nDeviation Difference to detect Power** \\n\\n0.3 1.5-fold >99% \\n2-fold >99% \\n4-fold >99% \\n\\n0.4 1.5-fold 95% \\n2-fold >99% \\n4-fold >99% \\n\\n0.5 1.5-fold 82% \\n2-fold >99% \\n4-fold >99% \\n\\n0.6 1.5-fold 67% \\n2-fold 98% \\n4-fold 100% \\n\\n*  Between two P2-VP8 dose groups or between a P2-VP8 vaccine dose and \\nthe placebo group \\n\\n**  Two-Sample T-Test Assuming Equal Variance using PASS 13. \\n \\n\\n7.5. Analytical Methodology \\nThe different populations to be used in data analysis are the following: \\n\\n• The per-protocol population (PP), which is defined as all randomized participants who \\nadhere to the protocol, complete all their scheduled visits, and present no major protocol \\nviolations, as defined prior to database lock. A “major” violation is defined as a protocol \\ndeviation that is considered to have an impact on the immunogenicity results of the \\nstudy. Volunteers are analyzed according to randomized treatment arm. \\n\\n• The safety population, which is defined as all participants who are randomize and \\nreceive at least one injection of the investigational product. Volunteers are analyzed \\naccording to treatment received rather than randomized treatment arm. \\n\\nThe primary objectives of the study are to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of \\nthe study vaccine. All safety data (solicited local and systemic reactions and unsolicited AEs \\nand SAEs) collected after participants are exposed to the study product will be included in the \\nprimary analysis of safety.  \\n\\nTo assess safety, the number and percentage of participants experiencing at least one AE, and \\nthe number and percentage of participants experiencing each specific AE, categorized by body \\nsystem and preferred term, will be tabulated by study cohort and product received along with \\ntheir corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Overall summaries by cohort and by product \\nreceived include the number and percentage of participants experiencing: (1) any SAE; (2) any \\nadverse experience; (3) any Grade 2 or greater AE; (4) any AE judged related to study product; \\n(5) any Grade 2 or greater AE judged related to study product. In addition, AEs will be \\nsummarized by grade.  \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 76 \\n\\nTo assess tolerability, the number and percentage of participants with Grade 2 or higher local or \\nsystemic reactions will be tabulated by study cohort and by product received along with their \\ncorresponding 95% confidence intervals. Local and systemic reactions will be tabulated \\nseparately. Overall summaries by cohort and by product received will include the number and \\npercentage of participants experiencing: (1) each specific reaction at Grade 2 or greater after \\neach injection; (2) each specific reaction at Grade 2 or greater after any injection; (3) any \\nreaction at Grade 2 or greater after each injection; and (4) any reaction at Grade 2 or greater \\nafter any injection. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the duration of local and \\nsystemic reactions. In addition, local and systemic reactions will be summarized by grade.  \\n\\nChanges in clinical laboratory values between baseline and one week after vaccination will be \\nanalyzed descriptively. \\n\\nImmunogenicity analysis will compare the rate of responses and geometric mean titers (GMTs) \\nbetween the various treatment groups based on injections received per protocol. To adjust for \\nthe decay in maternal antibody occurring concurrently with the IgG and neutralizing antibody \\nimmune responses to the vaccine, an analysis of the adjusted seroresponse rates utilizing the \\nexponential decay function based on the estimated half-life of the maternal antibody will be \\nperformed in addition to the analysis based on the unadjusted raw values. For each assay, an \\nestimated maternal antibody half-life will be derived from linear regression of LOG transformed \\ntiters in all infant placebo recipients, combined. Multiple components within each assay will be \\npooled (e.g. categorical class variable in the regression analysis) for the regression analysis to \\nobtain a single half-life estimate per assay. Any placebo recipient with suspected community \\nacquired rotavirus infection as identified by having a higher post vaccination titer higher than \\nthat at baseline, as well as those with values below the detectable limit of the assay at baseline \\nwill be excluded from the regression analysis.  \\n\\nThe following formula will be used to calculate the adjusted fold-rise and titer: \\n\\nfrma = 2^[(LOG2(titerx / titer0) + LOG2(2x/MH)) \\n\\ntiterma = 2^[LOG2(titerx) + LOG2(2x/MH)]  \\n\\n  where frma = maternal antibody adjusted fold-rise \\n  titerma = maternal antibody adjusted post-vaccination titer \\n  titerx = titer at Day x post Dose One \\n  titer0 = titer at pre-Dose One \\n  x = number of days post Dose One \\n  MH = maternal half-life in LOG2 scale \\n\\nFor each immune assay, the proportion of participants with a positive response at a specific \\ntime point or with any positive response at any time point will be evaluated using the 2-sided \\nexact binomial (Clopper-Pearson) 95% CI for each treatment group and compared between 2 \\ntreatment groups (i.e., between vaccine dose groups or between vaccine and placebo groups) \\nusing Fisher’s exact test. For continuous variables (i.e., titer/level of response), 2-sided 95% CI \\nfor the GMT for each treatment group using a t-distribution on log transformed titers/levels and \\n2-sample t-test on log transformed titers/levels will be used to compare between 2 treatment \\ngroups (i.e., between vaccine dose groups or between vaccine and placebo groups). A non-\\nparametric method (e.g., bootstrap or Wilcoxon rank sum test) will be used for continuous \\nvariables if the data are not consistent with the normal distribution.  \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 77 \\n\\nAssessment of shedding of Rotarix virus will be performed for each of the three specified post-\\nvaccination days and for shedding on any of the three days. Rates of shedding between the \\nplacebo and (1) each dose group and (2) the combined three dose groups will be compared \\nusing the Fisher’s exact test. \\n\\nWhen the use of descriptive statistics to assess group characteristics or differences is required, \\nthe following methods may be used: for categorical variables, the number and percent of \\nparticipants in each category; for continuous variables, the mean, median, standard deviation, \\nquartiles and range (minimum, maximum). Within-group assessment of the change from the \\nbaseline measurement to a follow-up measurement will be analyzed using McNemar’s test (for \\ncategorical response variables) or the paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test (for continuous \\nvariables). The following methods will be used for formal testing of differences between the \\nstudy vaccine and placebo: for binomial response variables, Fisher’s exact test and/or logistic \\nregression; for continuous variables, analysis of variance and/or Student’s t-test. The specific \\nsummary statistics and methods to be used for each endpoint will be described in the Statistical \\nAnalysis Plan. \\n\\nAll testing and inference will be performed with 2-sided p-value of 0.05. For each \\nimmunogenicity endpoint, a multiplicity adjustment for 4 treatment groups will be applied using a \\nsequential testing approach by performing an overall comparison of all treatment groups prior to \\npairwise comparisons. No multiplicity adjustment for multiple immunogenicity endpoints is \\nplanned, since the dose selection for the Phase 3 will be based on comprehensive statistical \\nand clinical evaluation of all immunogenicity endpoints including safety results. \\n\\n8. SAFETY ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING \\nThis section defines the types of safety events that should be reported and outlines the \\nprocedures for appropriately collecting, grading, recording and reporting them. \\n\\n8.1. Safety Events \\nAll safety events observed under this protocol will be reported through the AdvantageEDC data \\nsystem throughout the study. Information about vaccine reactogenicity (during the 7 days \\nfollowing vaccination) are collected on study-specific forms and are not captured on an Adverse \\nEvent form. Reactogenicity data (solicited signs or symptoms) will be collected through visit Day \\n7 post-study injection; if a solicited sign or symptom has started during the 7 days post study \\ninjection and continues beyond Day 7 it will continue to be reported as a reactogenicity \\nsymptom. Any symptom starting after 7 days post any study injection will be recorded as an AE. \\nOnly when a solicited sign or symptom is considered an SAE, as defined below, will it be \\nreported on an AE/SAE form set, in addition to the reactogenicity form. All other safety events \\nthat meet the definition of an AE or SAE that occur throughout the study are reported on the \\nAE/SAE form set. AE\\'s will be collected through study visit Day 84 in Groups A, C and D, and \\nthrough study Day 28 in Group B. SAEs and new major medical diagnoses will be assessed \\nthrough Day 224 in Groups A, C and D, and through Day 168 in Group B, and will be reported \\non the AE/SAE form set. \\n\\n8.2. Reporting Period \\nSafety events are reported from the time of the first study injection through completion of the \\nstudy at 6 months after the final injection (as above). For participants who withdraw or are \\nwithdrawn from the study, an early termination visit should occur 5-7 days after the last injection \\nor study visit to elicit occurrence of AEs (serious and non-serious).  \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 78 \\n\\n8.3.

Adverse Event (AE) or Medical Event  \\nAn adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in humans, whether or not considered \\nrelated to study product, that occurs during the conduct of a clinical trial. Any change from \\nbaseline assessment of clinical status, ECGs, routine laboratory tests, x-rays, physical \\nexaminations, etc., that is considered clinically significant by the site PI is considered an AE.  \\n\\nSuspected adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the \\nstudy product caused the AE. A reasonable possibility implies that there is evidence that the \\nstudy product caused the event. \\n\\nAdverse reaction is any AE caused by the vaccine.  \\n8.3.2. Serious Adverse Events (Defined as Serious Adverse Events, Serious Suspected \\n\\nAdverse Reactions or Serious Adverse Reactions)  \\nAn SAE, including a serious suspected adverse reaction or serious adverse reaction as \\ndetermined by the site PI or the Sponsor, is any event that results in any of the following \\noutcomes: \\n\\n1. Death \\n\\n2. Life-threatening AE (Life-threatening means that the study participant was, in the opinion \\nof the site PI or Sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred.)  \\n\\n3. Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  \\n4. Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct \\n\\nnormal life functions  \\n\\n5. Congenital abnormality or birth defect \\n\\n6. Important medical event that may not result in one of the above outcomes but may \\njeopardize the health of the study participant or require medical or surgical intervention \\nto prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition of serious event  \\n\\n8.3.3. Unexpected Adverse Event  \\nAn AE is “unexpected” when its nature (specificity) or severity is not consistent with applicable \\nproduct information, such as safety information provided in the Investigators’ Brochure (IB), the \\ninvestigational plan or the protocol.  \\n\\n8.4. Toxicity Grading  \\nThe study clinic assigns toxicity grades to indicate the severity of adverse experiences and \\ntoxicities. The toxicity grading criteria provided in Appendix II grade AEs from Mild (grade 1) to \\nLife Threatening (grade 4). All AEs leading to death are Grade 5 events. AEs are graded with \\nthe worst severity grade during the illness/symptoms. AE severity will be graded using the \\nattached grading scale (Appendix II), which has been developed on the basis of Division of \\nAIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, version \\n2.0, November 2014, of the US National Institutes of Health, with modifications to reflect local \\npopulation norms. For laboratory values not included in Appendix II, grading will be based on \\nthe Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse \\nEvents, version 2.0, November 2014, available at webpage:  \\n\\nhttp://rsc.tech-res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance/gradingtables.aspx \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 79 \\n\\n8.4.1. Guidelines for Determining Causality of an Adverse Event \\nAll AEs, and SAEs, will be assessed for a causal relationship with the study product by the site \\nPI. Appropriate medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all \\nrelevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal sequence and relationship, biological \\nplausibility, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and \\nrelevant history. Assessment of causal relationship should be recorded in the AE and in SAE \\nforms. \\nThe site PI should consider the following question when assessing causality of an AE to study \\nproduct:  \\n\\nIs there a reasonable possibility that the product caused the event? \\n\\nReasonable possibility implies there is evidence that the study product caused the reported \\nevent. An affirmative answer designates the event as a suspected adverse reaction, and the AE \\nis therefore considered “related.” If the answer is no, then the AE is considered “unrelated.” \\n\\n8.5. Adverse Event Identification, Resolution and Reporting \\nTo improve the quality and precision of acquired AE data, the site PI should observe the \\nfollowing guidelines: \\n\\n• Whenever possible, use recognized medical terms when recording AEs on the AE CRF. \\nDo not use colloquialisms and/or abbreviations. \\n\\n• If known, record the diagnosis (i.e., disease or syndrome) rather than component signs, \\nsymptoms and laboratory values on the AE CRF (e.g., record congestive heart failure \\nrather than dyspnea, rales, and cyanosis). However, signs and symptoms that are \\nconsidered unrelated to an encountered syndrome or disease should be recorded as \\nindividual AEs on the CRF (e.g., if congestive heart failure and severe headache are \\nobserved at the same time, each event should be recorded as an individual AE). \\n\\n• AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., sequelae) should be identified by the \\nprimary cause. A “primary” AE, if clearly identifiable, generally represents the most \\naccurate clinical term to record on the AE CRF. If a primary serious AE (SAE) is \\nrecorded on an SAE CRF, events occurring secondary to the primary event should be \\ndescribed in the narrative description of the case. \\n\\n• Grade 2 or higher abnormal laboratory test results will be entered as AEs with the \\ntoxicity grade associated with the abnormal laboratory test and attribution of the \\nabnormality relative to the study product. Grade 1 abnormal laboratory test results will be \\nentered as AEs if the site PI determines them to be clinically significant. \\n\\n• Death is an outcome of an event. The event that resulted in the death should be \\nrecorded and reported on the SAE CRF. \\n\\n• For hospitalizations for surgical or diagnostic procedures, the illness leading to the \\nsurgical or diagnostic procedure should be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure \\nitself. The procedure should be captured in the case narrative as part of the action taken \\nin response to the illness. \\n\\nAEs may be discovered through any of these methods. \\n\\n• Observing the participant. \\n• Questioning the participant’s parent, which should be done in an objective manner. \\n• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant’s parent. \\n• Review of medical records/source documents. \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 80 \\n\\nEach participant will have a scheduled observation following each study injection, including a \\nsymptom-directed physical examination, if indicated. Participants will be monitored in the clinic for \\nat least 30 minutes after each study injection. On Days 0 to 7 after each study injection, \\nparticipants and parents will be instructed to assess and record daily in a participant memory aid \\nany signs and symptoms at the study injection site (injection site pain/tenderness, redness, \\nswelling, itching), as well as systemic signs and symptoms (fever, headache, vomiting, nausea, \\nfatigue, chills and myalgia for adults; and fever, vomiting, decreased appetite, irritability, and \\ndecreased activity for toddlers and infants). Follow-up visits will be conducted on post-study \\ninjection Days 3 and 7 in toddlers and infants and Day 7 in adults, including verification of memory \\naid notes and directed assessment. On Day 7 in Groups A, B and C, blood will be drawn for \\nmonitoring hematology and chemistry tests. Participants/parents will be instructed to call the study \\nteam if they observe significant injection site or systemic signs or symptoms, and then to continue \\nmonitoring and reporting their children’s condition. All participants will be followed for safety for six \\nmonths after the last injection, with follow-up by telephone or clinic visit. \\n\\n8.5.1. AE Resolution \\nAll reported AEs should be followed until resolution or stabilization, or until completion of the \\nstudy. Participants who have an ongoing study product-related SAE at study completion or at \\ndiscontinuation from the study will be followed by the site PI or designee until the event is \\nresolved or determined to be irreversible, chronic, or stable by the site PI. \\n\\n8.5.2. General Recording and Reporting Procedures \\nA multi-page AE/SAE form set will be used, allowing all AEs to be submitted through a single \\nreporting mechanism. SAEs will require additional information reported on additional pages \\nwithin the AdvantageEDC data system. As appropriate or per request of the Emmes medical \\nmonitor or PATH medical officer, source documents (e.g., hospitalization discharge summaries) \\nmay be uploaded to the AE/SAE form set, as well (with care taken to remove personal \\nidentifiers). The site PI will treat or refer, as appropriate, participants experiencing AEs and \\nobserve them at suitable intervals until their symptoms resolve or their status stabilizes. \\n\\n8.5.3. SAE Recording and Reporting Procedures \\nSAEs will be recorded on the AE case report form (CRF). The site is obligated to report SAEs to \\nthe Emmes Coordinating Center within 24 hours of the site’s knowledge of the event. The \\nfollowing attributes will be assigned by the site PI or assignment by designee will undergo \\ndocumented review by the site PI:  \\n\\n• Description \\n• Date of onset and resolution (if known when reported) \\n• Severity \\n• Assessment of relatedness to test article  \\n• Action taken \\n\\nThe site PI will apply clinical judgment to determine whether an AE is of sufficient severity to \\nrequire discontinuation of administration of study injection for that participant. If necessary, the \\nsite PI will suspend any trial procedures and institute the necessary medical therapy to protect a \\nparticipant from any immediate danger. \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 81 \\n\\n8.5.4. Site Reporting of Events \\n• Notify the site PI. \\n• Complete and transmit an AE Form through the AdvantageEDC data system. \\n\\nInformation regarding a SAE report must be recorded in the participant’s medical chart \\nand entered in the AdvantageEDC data system. \\n\\n• SAE reports should include hospital admittance notes, hospital discharge summary, \\nclinical notes, resolution date, treatment, and any other pertinent information regarding \\nthe event. If not immediately available, reporting should not be delayed to provide these \\ndocuments. \\n\\n• In the event of a death, the SAE Form must be completed and transmitted along with \\nother supporting data (e.g., death certificate, medical notes). \\n\\nFigure 9: Reporting Decisions for Adverse Events \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n8.6. Serious Adverse Event Notification \\n8.6.1. Notifications and Review \\nThe site PIs will provide the Emmes Coordinating Center with data for all SAEs, as defined per \\nthe protocol, on an ongoing basis by entering the information in AdvantageEDC. The Emmes \\nCoordinating Center is responsible for notifying the Sponsor and the CRO performing site \\nmonitoring and will do so simultaneously with the reporting to the clinical database. Notification \\nof reported events will be generated at the time of entry into the data system, and all SAEs will \\nbe reviewed promptly by the Emmes medical monitor within the data system. As noted above, \\nthis notification should be within 24 hours of site awareness of the event. Site personnel will be \\ntrained in reporting AEs and SAEs.  \\n\\nThe Emmes medical monitor will review all unanticipated events involving risk to participants or \\nothers, SAEs and all participant deaths associated with the protocol and will provide a written \\nreport. At a minimum, the Emmes medical monitor must comment on the outcomes of the event \\nor problem and, in case of an SAE or death, comment on the relationship to participation in the \\nstudy. The Emmes medical monitor must also indicate whether he/she concurs with the details \\nof the report provided by the site PI. \\n\\nSummary review of all reported AEs and SAEs will be compiled on a weekly basis to identify \\nany safety trends. Review of reactogenicity and safety monitoring laboratory tests will also be \\nconducted on a weekly basis during the periods such monitoring is being performed. \\n\\nNo Yes \\n\\nSafety Event requiring AE Form Submission: \\nAll adverse events and all serious adverse events \\n\\nSAE? \\n\\nExpedited Reporting \\n(within 24 hours of site awareness) \\n\\nUse the Adverse Event Form \\n\\nSubmit to Emmes Coordinating Center \\n(also notify ethics board/IRB) \\n\\nStandard Reporting \\n(within 7 days) \\n\\nUse the Adverse Event Form  \\nand other CRFs \\n\\nSubmit to Emmes Coordinating Center \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 82 \\n\\n8.6.2. Expedited Reporting \\nThe Emmes Coordinating Center will be responsible for expedited Safety Reports and IND \\nAnnual reports to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). SCT Consulting will be \\nresponsible for reporting to the South African Medicines Control Council (MCC). \\n\\nFDA Reporting \\nWhen expedited reports as defined below are required, the cover memorandum, \\nMedWatch Form FDA 3500A, and any pertinent attachments will be processed by the \\nEmmes medical monitor and a copy of the completed report will be submitted by fax or \\ncourier delivery before the regulatory reporting deadline, to the following persons: \\n\\n• FDA medical officer as appropriate (submitted as an amendment to the applicable IND) \\n\\n• Site PI (who is responsible for forwarding the report to the local EC/IRB) \\n\\n• SRC independent medical monitors  \\n\\n• PATH medical officer \\n\\nIf relevant follow-up information becomes available, the Emmes medical monitor will be \\nresponsible for obtaining and reviewing details from the site. A follow-up MedWatch form \\nwill be completed and forwarded to all parties that received the earlier SAE report. A \\ncopy of the safety sections for annual FDA reports will be forwarded to PVS.  \\n\\nSuspected adverse reactions that are serious and unexpected will be reported to the \\nFDA within 15 days, or for deaths and life threatening events that are both suspected \\nadverse reactions and unexpected, within 7 days (per 21 CFR 312.32). \\n\\nMCC Reporting \\nSCT Consulting will be responsible for reporting to the MCC. \\n\\nAll fatal and life-threatening, unexpected adverse drug reactions should be reported \\nwithin 7 calendar days after first knowledge by the applicant. The initial notification must \\nbe followed by as complete a report as possible, within an additional 8 calendar days.  \\n\\nSerious, unexpected adverse drug reactions that are not fatal or life-threatening must be \\nreported as soon as possible, and not later than 15 calendar days after first knowledge \\nby the applicant. \\n\\nThe MCC must be notified, within 15 calendar days after first knowledge by the \\napplicant, when there is a suggestion of a change in the nature, severity or frequency of \\nexpected adverse drug reactions or when new risk factors are identified. The basis on \\nwhich these assessments are made should be included.  \\n\\nAny information, that may in any way influence the benefit-risk assessment of a \\nmedicine or that would be sufficient to consider changes in the administration of the \\nmedicine or in the overall conduct of a clinical trial, must be reported to the MCC. The \\napplicant must submit this information to the MCC within three calendar days of first \\nknowledge by the applicant.  \\n\\nSubsequent review by the MCC, FDA, the SRC, EC/IRB, or the Sponsor may suspend further \\nstudy product administration or procedures. The study Sponsor, MCC, FDA and SRC retain the \\nauthority to suspend additional enrollment and treatments for the entire study as applicable. \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 83 \\n\\n8.6.3. Notifying the Protocol Safety Review Committee \\nThe Emmes Coordinating Center will provide the SRC with listings of all SAEs on an ongoing \\nbasis. Furthermore, the SRC will be informed of expedited reports of SAEs. \\n\\n8.6.4. Notifying the Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board \\nThe site PIs will ensure the timely dissemination of required SAE information, including \\nexpedited reports, to their respective local ethics committees in compliance with applicable local \\nregulations and guidelines. The site PIs are responsible for submitting the safety report (initial \\nand follow up SAE reports) or other safety information (e.g., revised IB) to their respective ethics \\ncommittees and for retaining a copy in the site’s study file. \\n\\nWIRB Guidelines \\nAll SAEs will be reported to WIRB by PVS according to WIRB guidelines and using the WIRB \\nTen Day Adverse Event Form. \\n\\nWIRB Phone: 800-562-4789, Fax: 360-252-2498.  \\n\\n9. SAFETY MONITORING \\nExtensive safety monitoring will be provided for this protocol. The site PIs and/or designated site \\nstaff will be responsible for continuous close safety monitoring of all study participants and for \\nalerting the Sponsor if unexpected concerns arise or stopping criteria are met.  \\n\\n9.1. Safety Review Committee  \\nA SRC, comprised of the site PIs from each study site, the Sponsor medical monitor, the \\nEmmes medical monitor and two independent local medical experts, will monitor safety \\nthroughout the duration of the study (in addition to the Data Safety Monitoring Board described \\nin section 8.2). The responsibilities and procedures of the SRC will be defined in the SRC \\nCharter. The study statistician with assistance of the data management staff will prepare safety \\nreports as needed for SRC discussions. In addition to routine review of safety information, a \\ncentral role of the SRC is the review of safety data for the recommendation of whether to \\nprogress to the next dose level in each age cohort and to the next age cohort. Cumulative safety \\ndata will be available continuously for review by SRC members, and safety reports will be \\nprepared for each SRC deliberation of dose escalation (see Section 9.4, Dose Escalation) and \\nprogression to subsequent cohorts (adults to toddlers and toddlers to infants). \\n\\nThe SRC members will review the safety data throughout the study to determine whether pause \\ncriteria have been met. The SRC will be notified by the Emmes Coordinating Center and \\nconvene by conference call if pause criteria may have been met. The SRC may request review \\nof unblinded safety data by the independent SRC members in deliberating whether to refer \\nconcerns and events to the DSMB. If pause criteria are met, the DSMB is to be notified and \\nconvened, as described in section 9.4. \\n\\nThe SRC may make recommendations regarding permanent discontinuation of administration of \\nstudy product in individual participants based on careful review of all relevant data.  \\n\\nSRC reviews will be summarized with recommendations to the study Sponsor. \\n\\n9.2. Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  \\nA DSMB formed by independent vaccine, pediatric and infectious disease experts, as well as a \\nbiostatistician, will be established to periodically review cumulative data, as needed. The \\nresponsibilities and procedures of the DSMB will be defined in the DSMB Charter. The DSMB \\nwill be responsible for safeguarding the interests of trial participants, assessing safety during the \\ntrial, and for monitoring the overall conduct of the clinical trial. The DSMB will provide \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 84 \\n\\nrecommendations about continuing, modifying or stopping the trial. Items reviewed by the \\nDSMB will include: study participant accrual and demographic information; interim/cumulative \\nsafety data; discontinuations of study injections; factors that might affect the study outcome or \\ncompromise the confidentiality of the trial data (such as treatment and endpoint unbinding); data \\nquality, completeness, and timeliness; and factors external to the study, such as scientific or \\ntherapeutic developments that may impact participant safety or the ethics of the study.  \\n\\nThe DSMB will convene prior to study initiation and then at least every six months. In addition to \\nroutinely scheduled calls, if the protocol team or SRC has serious safety concerns or study \\npause criteria are met, the DSMB will convene by teleconference to jointly review the data. The \\nDSMB reviews will be summarized with recommendations to the study Sponsor as to \\nwhether there are safety concerns and whether the study should continue without change, be \\nmodified, or be terminated.  \\n\\nIf at any time, a decision is made to permanently discontinue administration of study product in \\nall participants, expeditious notification will be provided by PVS to the U.S. FDA (via Emmes \\nCoordinating Center) and WIRB, to the MCC (via SCT Consulting) and by the site PIs to their \\nrespective local ECs.  \\n\\n9.3. Withdrawal for Safety \\nA participant may be withdrawn from further study injections for safety-related reasons, at the \\ndiscretion of the site PIs, Emmes medical monitor, PATH medical officer, SRC independent \\nmembers, or the participant/participant’s parent. \\n\\nParticipants/parents may withdraw from study product administration for any other reason. If \\nwithdrawal is requested, the participants/parents should be asked to continue (at least limited) \\nscheduled evaluations, complete a study termination form, and be given appropriate care under \\nmedical supervision until symptoms of any AE resolve or any condition becomes stable. \\n\\n9.4. Study Pause  \\nStudy pause is defined as a decision to cease, temporarily or permanently, enrollment and all \\nstudy injections. Study pause will not eliminate any safety follow-up procedures specified by \\nprotocol. The Sponsor will pause the study if the SRC determines that study pause criteria have \\nbeen met. The DSMB will be convened by teleconference to review study pauses and provide \\nrecommendations to the Sponsor regarding continuation or permanent discontinuation of study \\nvaccinations, or study modification. \\n\\n9.4.1. Study Pause Rules  \\nThe following study pause rules will automatically pause or halt further study injections. These \\nstopping rules refer to suspected adverse reactions, as defined below: \\n\\nStudy pause rules: Meeting one or more of the following criteria will automatically pause or halt \\nfurther study injections in the study. These pause rules refer to suspected adverse reactions \\nacross all cohorts, as defined below: \\n\\n• One participant with a vaccine-related serious AE (SAE). \\n\\n• Two participants with ≥grade 3 (severe) localized inflammatory reaction at the injection \\nsite.  \\n\\n• The same objective ≥grade 3 (severe) systemic reactogenicity signs or symptoms (fever, \\nvomiting), within seven days following study injection in three participants in Groups A, B \\nor C, and ≥5% of participants in Group D. \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 85 \\n\\n• Two participants with a systemic rash, including, but not limited to, generalized urticaria, \\ngeneralized petechiae, or erythema multiforme, within seven days following study \\ninjection. \\n\\n• Two participants with the same ≥grade 3 (severe) vaccine-related abnormal clinical \\nlaboratory evaluation, within seven days following study injection. \\n\\n9.4.2. Study Pause Procedure \\n\\n• If the site PI (or designee), the Emmes medical monitor or any member of the SRC \\nidentifies that a pause criterion may have been met or proposes that the study be \\npaused on a discretionary basis, all study injections and enrollment will be suspended. \\nThe DSMB will be notified and will convene expeditiously by conference call to review all \\navailable and relevant information, confirm whether pause criteria have been met, and \\nprovide recommendations to the Sponsor to permanently halt, re-start or otherwise \\nmodify the study. In the event that the study is permanently stopped, the HREC and \\nWIRB will be notified within 48 hours. \\n\\n• At scheduled study review meetings, the SRC may determine that pause criteria have \\nbeen met, and the DSMB will be notified, as above.  \\n\\n• If the Sponsor re-starts the study after DSMB review and recommendation to restart, \\nstudy injections may resume. Study injections that are delayed beyond the protocol-\\nspecified window may be administered. The appropriate follow-up and subsequent \\ninjection schedule for participants with delayed study injections will be determined by the \\nSponsor on a case-by-case basis. \\n\\n9.5. Dose Escalation \\nThe SRC will review available safety data through post-study injection Day 7 for all Group A \\nparticipants in the 30 µg dose group (including safety monitoring laboratory tests) and determine \\nwhether to proceed with enrollment of the 90 µg dose group.  \\n\\nThe SRC’s evaluation of the safety data through Day 7 of all Group A participants in the 30 µg \\ndose group, and any other safety data from Cohort A available at that time, will also be the basis \\nfor determining whether it is safe to proceed with enrollment of the 30 µg dose group in Group \\nB. As above, the SRC will review safety data through post-study injection Day 7 in both the \\ngroup A 90 µg dose and the group B 30 µg dose in deciding whether to progress from the 30 µg \\ndose group to the 90 µg dose in Group B. \\n\\nSimilarly, the SRC’s evaluation of the safety data through Day 7 of all Group B participants in \\nthe 30 µg dose group, and any other safety data from Groups A and B available at that time, will \\nalso be the basis for determining whether it is safe to proceed with enrollment of the 15 µg dose \\ngroup in Group C. As above, the SRC will review safety data through post-study injection Day 7 \\nin deciding whether to progress from the 15 µg dose group to the 30 µg dose in Group C, and \\nthen from the 30 µg dose group to the 90 µg dose. \\n\\nThe SRC will review the safety data through Day 7 for all participants in Groups A, B and C, and \\nany additional data available at the time of deliberation, and determine whether to proceed with \\nenrollment of Group D. \\n\\n  \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 86 \\n\\n10. DATA MANAGEMENT \\nThe site PIs are responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the \\ndata reported. Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the study site under \\nthe supervision of the site PIs. The Emmes Corporation is responsible for data management \\nactivities, including quality review, analysis, and reporting of the study data according to SOPs. \\n\\n10.1. Case Report Form Development and Completion \\nElectronic Data Capture (EDC) will be the method of data collection in this study. The eCRFs \\nwill be developed by The Emmes Corporation and approved by PVS. Clinical data (including \\nAEs, concomitant medications, and reactogenicity data) and clinical laboratory data will be \\nentered into the 21 CFR Part 11-compliant Internet Data Entry System (IDES) provided by The \\nEmmes Corporation. The data system includes password protection and internal quality checks, \\nsuch as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or \\ninaccurate. Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents.  \\n\\nData for each participant will be recorded in the eCRF. It is the site PIs’ responsibility to ensure \\nthe accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported in the participant’s eCRF and \\nany supporting documentation. All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible \\nmanner to ensure accurate interpretation of data. Source documentation supporting the eCRF \\ndata should document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs and participant status. \\nThe site PIs/institutions will maintain all information in the eCRFs and all source documents that \\nsupport the data collected from each participant. \\n\\nThe site PIs or designated representatives should complete the eCRFs as soon as possible \\nafter information is collected. Completed eCRFs must be submitted for each screened \\nparticipant who signs (or whose parent signs) the study-specific informed consent form (ICF). \\nThe site PIs will retain all essential documents and a CD-ROM copy of the eCRF data (after the \\nstudy is closed and unblinded and the Clinical Study Report is completed or at such time that \\nthe site no longer has access to the electronic data system). \\n\\n10.2. Details of Data Management \\nA Data Management Handbook (DMH) will be written by The Emmes Corporation and contain \\nall study-specific requirements.  \\n\\n10.2.1. Data Validation \\nThe Emmes Corporation will inspect the data entered into the database for completeness and \\nconsistency.  \\n\\n10.2.2. Source Data Verification \\n\\nFor source data verification (SDV), the monitor (on behalf of the study Sponsor) must have \\ndirect access to source documents that support the data recorded, e.g., medical records, \\noriginal laboratory records and ICFs. If source data are electronic, these data must be printed, \\nsigned and dated by the site PI and stored in the participant’s study file. Clinical laboratory data \\nwill remain in study participant records. Essential documents, including ICFs, must be filed and \\nkept in the study files on an ongoing basis. \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 87 \\n\\n10.2.3. Definition of Source Data  \\nSource data are all information in original records or certified copies of original records of clinical \\nfindings, observations, or other activities in a clinical study. Source data are contained in source \\ndocuments.  \\n\\n10.2.4. Definition of Source Document \\nOriginal source documents include data and records, e.g., hospital records, medical notes, \\nlaboratory notes, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, records kept at the \\npharmacy and at the laboratory, documentation of shipments. Note that, for this protocol, the \\nparticipant data collection tool (i.e., the Memory Aid) is not considered a source document \\n(Refer to Appendix III) Data reported in the eCRF derived from source documents should be \\nconsistent with the source documents or the discrepancies should be explained. \\n\\n10.3. Database Locking Procedures \\nA final database lock for the primary analysis will occur after all participants have completed all \\nfollow-up visits, including the 6 month safety follow-up call, a case-by-case review of the \\nseverity of any AEs has been performed and finalized, all data anomalies have been resolved \\nand monitoring is complete.  \\n\\nRemaining immunology data will be maintained in a separate immunology database.  \\n\\n10.4. Record Archival  \\nThe site PIs are responsible for retaining study records for a period of 2 years following the date \\nthat a marketing application is approved for the product or, if no application is to be filed or, if a \\nfile application is not approved, until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and the FDA \\nis notified. The Sponsor will be responsible for providing the site with date of vaccine approval \\nor IND withdrawal. \\n\\nThese records are also to be maintained in compliance with local EC and local authority medical \\nrecords retention requirements, whichever is longest. Storage of all trial-related documents will \\nbe such that confidentiality will be strictly maintained to the extent provided by US and local law.  \\n\\n10.5. Screen Failures \\n\\nIf a participant or participant’s parent signs the ICF but the participant is not randomized \\nbecause of ineligibility (a screen failure), the reason for his/her ineligibility should be entered in \\nthe medical records/notes/charts. Also, a screening log must be kept. Data from participants \\nwho fail screening will not be recorded in the eCRF, with the exception of demographic data and \\nthe reason for screen fail.  \\n\\n10.6. Protocol Deviations \\n\\nA protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, GCP, or site SOP \\nrequirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the site PI, or the \\nstudy site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the site and \\nimplemented promptly.  \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 88 \\n\\nThese practices are consistent with ICH E6: \\n\\n• Compliance with Protocol, Sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3 \\n\\n• Quality Assurance and Quality Control, Section 5.1.1 \\n\\n• Noncompliance, Sections 5.20.1 and 5.20.2. \\n\\nIt is the responsibility of the site to exercise continuous vigilance to identify and report deviations \\nwithin 5 working days after identification of the protocol deviation, or within 5 working days of the \\nscheduled protocol-required activity. All deviations must be promptly reported via the \\nappropriate eCRF within the electronic data system.  \\n\\nAll deviations from the protocol must be addressed in study participant source documents. A \\ncompleted copy of WIRB reportable Protocol Deviation forms must be maintained in the \\nregulatory file, as well as in the participant’s source document. Protocol deviations must be sent \\nto the local EC per its guidelines. The site PI/study staff is responsible for knowing and adhering \\nto the respective EC’s requirements. \\n\\n11. STUDY MONITORING \\nSponsor monitoring responsibilities will be provided through a CRO, SCT Consulting, \\nexperienced in monitoring clinical site activity. A site initiation visit will be conducted prior to \\nbeginning the study, and monitoring will be conducted at initiation, during, and at closeout of the \\nstudy by the study monitor or designee.  \\n\\nDuring the course of the study, the monitor will visit the clinical site at intervals to verify \\ncompliance to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data and study \\nproduct accountability; adherence to CFR and MCC regulations, and any additional regulations \\nand requirements, including GCP, of the conduct of clinical research. The monitor should have \\naccess to participant medical records, study product accountability and other study-related \\nrecords needed to verify the entries on the eCRFs. \\n\\nThe site PIs and the monitor must agree to cooperate to ensure that any problems detected in \\nthe course of these monitoring visits, including eCRF completion and query resolution, are \\nresolved in a predefined timeframe.  \\n\\nTo ensure the quality of clinical data across all participants at the site, a clinical data \\nmanagement review will be performed on participant data received at The Emmes Corporation. \\nDuring this review, participant data will be checked for consistency, omissions, and any \\napparent discrepancies. In addition, the data will be reviewed for adherence to the protocol and \\nGCP. To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review process, data \\nqueries and/or site notifications will be sent to the site for resolution as soon as possible; all \\nqueries must be resolved prior to database lock. \\n\\nEssential documents must be filed in the site study file on an ongoing basis and available for \\nreview by the Sponsor’s contracted site monitor. Monitoring visits will be performed according to \\nthe Clinical Monitoring Plan. \\n\\n11.1. Independent Auditing \\nPVS representatives may audit the study to ensure that study procedures and data collected \\ncomply with the protocol and applicable SOPs at the clinical site and The Emmes Corporation, \\nand that data are correct and complete. The site PIs will permit auditors (employees of the \\nSponsor or an external company designated by the Sponsor) to verify source data validation of \\nthe regularly monitored clinical study. The auditors will compare the entries in the eCRFs with \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 89 \\n\\nthe source data and evaluate the study site for its adherence to the clinical study protocol and \\nGCP guidelines and applicable regulatory requirements. \\n\\n11.2. Regulatory Agency Auditing \\nThe site PIs must be aware that representatives from regulatory authorities or WIRB and their \\nlocal ECs may wish to inspect the eCRFs and associated study records. The site PIs will notify \\nthe Sponsor within 24 hours following contact by a regulatory agency. The site PIs and study \\ncoordinators must make the relevant records available for inspection and will be available to \\nrespond to reasonable requests and audit queries made by authorized representatives of \\nregulatory agencies. The site PIs will provide the Sponsor with copies of all correspondence that \\nmay affect the review of the current study or his qualification as an investigator in clinical studies \\nconducted by the Sponsor. The Sponsor will provide any needed assistance in responding to \\nregulatory audits or correspondence. \\n\\n12. OBLIGATIONS AND ROLES OF THE SPONSOR, SITE PIS AND STUDY PERSONNEL  \\nThis study will be conducted according to GCP and in accordance with all US federal \\nregulations regarding the protection of human subjects in research including US 21 CFR Part 50 \\nand US 21 CFR Part 312, as well in accordance with South African MCC regulations.  \\n\\nThe Sponsor will assure the trial is conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and \\nregulatory authority requirements. The Sponsor will provide the investigators with the funding \\nand information needed to conduct the trial properly, ensuring proper monitoring of trial activities \\nand that the trial is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols \\ncontained in the submissions to the regulatory authorities. The Sponsor will ensure that \\nregulatory authorities and the investigators are promptly informed of significant new adverse \\neffects or risks with respect to the study vaccine. \\n\\nThe site PIs agree to perform the research in strict accordance with this protocol, the \\nInternational Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (E6), as \\nwell as in conformity with any US or local regulations regarding the conduct of clinical studies. \\n\\nIn addition, the site PIs must follow local and institutional requirements including, but not limited \\nto, investigational product, clinical research, informed consent and local EC requirements. The \\nSponsor will provide notification to the site PIs of protocol and amendment approvals by \\nregulatory authorities when applicable. Any modifications to the research protocol, the ICF, \\nand/or the questionnaires or change in site PIs must be submitted to WIRB and respective local \\nEC for review and approval prior to implementation. The site PIs may deviate from the protocol \\nwithout prior approval only when the deviation is necessary to eliminate an apparent immediate \\nhazard to the participant.  \\n\\nThe site PIs will notify their respective ECs of SAEs and protocol deviations according to their \\nEC requirements. Any deviation to the protocol that may have an effect on the safety or rights of \\nthe participant, or the integrity of the study, must be reported to the Sponsor by the site PIs as \\nsoon as the deviation is identified. In that event, the site PIs will notify the Sponsor immediately \\nby phone, notify their respective ECs, enter the deviation into the appropriate eCRF, and \\nconfirm notification to the Sponsor in writing within 10 working days after the change is \\nimplemented. All deviations will be noted in the continuing review report to the respective ECs, \\nthe annual report to the Sponsor, and in the final study report for the ECs. \\n\\nExcept where the site PIs’ signatures are specifically required, it is understood that the term \\n\"investigator\" as used in this protocol and on the electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) refers \\nto the site PIs or appropriate study personnel that the site PIs designate to perform a certain \\nduty. The site PIs are ultimately responsible for the conduct of all aspects of the study. Sub-\\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 90 \\n\\ninvestigators or other appropriate study personnel are eligible to sign for the site PIs on \\ndesignated eCRFs. \\n\\nThe Emmes medical monitor will be responsible for reviewing all serious and unexpected AEs \\nand providing an unbiased written report of the event. \\n\\n13. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND INFORMED CONSENT \\n13.1. Informed Consent Process \\nBefore any study-related activities and in agreement with applicable regulatory requirements, \\nthe site PI must ensure that the participant’s parent is fully informed about the aims, procedures, \\npotential risks, and potential benefits of the study. The participant/participant’s parent will be \\ngiven the written, local EC/WIRB approved ICF, allowed ample time to read the consent form, \\nencouraged to ask questions about the study, have the questions answered and then be given \\ntime to decide if s/he would like to participate or have her/his child participate in the study. It will \\nbe emphasized that participation is voluntary, and that the participant/parent has the right to \\nwithdraw from the study at any time without prejudice. \\n\\nThe site PIs or designees must obtain the participant’s/parent’s voluntary, signed and dated ICF \\n(or, if the participant/parent is unable to sign, independently witnessed and documented \\nconsent) before any study-related procedures are performed. Study staff must document the \\ninformed consent process. The original, signed ICF must be kept in the site study file.  \\n\\n13.2. Risk/Benefit  \\nNo benefits can be guaranteed to participants for their participation in this research study.  \\n\\nPrevious experience with the study product is limited to the first in human trial of the monovalent \\n(P[8]) P2-VP8 subunit vaccine conducted in the United States and the ongoing study in toddlers \\nand infants in South Africa. In those trials, the vaccine has been well-tolerated, with \\nreactogenicity, when it occurred, predominantly mild in nature and no vaccine related SAEs \\nwere observed. See Section 1.6 for details. \\n\\nAs with any vaccine, severe allergic reaction is a potential rare event. None were observed in \\ntwo clinical trials with the monovalent vaccine. \\n\\nIn this trial, participants in the infant groups are to receive Rotarix following completion of the \\nstudy product series, to provide the protection that licensed vaccine provides. As it cannot yet \\nbe demonstrated that the P2-VP8 subunit vaccine does not interfere with response to Rotarix, \\nparticipants will be provided a third dose of Rotarix. Additional risk mitigation will be provided by \\nclinical monitoring and access to clinical evaluation and management. \\n\\n13.3. Protocol Review Process \\nScientific review of this protocol will be conducted by PATH. The protocol will be submitted the \\nexisting IND at the US FDA and to the MCC. The IND Sponsor will be PVS. Protocol ethical \\nreview and oversight will be performed by each site’s local EC and WIRB. Continuing review will \\nbe undertaken in accordance with existing regulations. The Sponsor will be responsible for trial \\nregistration at ClinicalTrials.gov. \\n\\nCopies of the approved continuing review and final study reports, along with the respective local \\nIRB approval notifications, will be submitted to the Sponsor as soon as these documents \\nbecome available. \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 91 \\n\\n13.4. Participant Confidentiality \\nThe site PIs must ensure that participant confidentiality is maintained. Personal identifiers will \\nnot be included in any study reports. All study records will be kept confidential to the extent \\nprovided by national and local laws.  \\n\\nAll study procedures will be conducted per GCP guidelines, and every effort will be made to \\nprotect participant privacy and confidentiality to the extent possible.  \\n\\nAll study-related information will be stored securely at the study site or at a designated, secure \\noff-site location. When not in use and under immediate control of study staff, all participant \\ninformation will be stored in locked areas with access limited to study staff. Data collection, \\nprocess, and administrative forms, laboratory specimens, and other reports will be identified \\nexclusively by a coded number to maintain participant confidentiality. All local databases will be \\nsecured with password-protected access systems. Participants’ study information will not be \\nreleased without written parental permission, except as necessary for monitoring or compliance \\nwith legal or regulatory requirements. \\n\\nMedical records containing identifying information may be made available for review when the \\nstudy is monitored by the Sponsor or an authorized regulatory agency. Direct access may \\ninclude examining, analyzing, verifying, and reproducing any records and reports that are \\nimportant to the evaluation of the study. \\n\\n13.5. Reimbursement  \\nPending local EC approval, participants/parents of participants will be compensated for their \\ntime and effort in this study, and be reimbursed for travel to study visits. The study ICF will state \\nthe plan for reimbursement. Participants/parents of study participants will not be charged for \\nstudy injections, research clinic visits, research-related examinations, or research-related \\nlaboratory tests. \\n\\n13.6. Storage of Specimens  \\nStored study research samples (including samples retained for elective analysis) will be labeled \\nby a code that only the study site can link to the participant. All stored research samples will be \\nlogged into a secure database and any use documented. Samples may be stored at several \\ndifferent repositories and laboratories to complete the analyses required to meet study primary, \\nsecondary and exploratory analyses. As a part of the informed consent process, participants will \\nbe informed of and asked to agree to long-term storage of specimens for use in future, related \\nresearch.  \\n\\n14.

APPENDIX III: Memory Aid \\nParticipant and Parental Assessments and Use of Memory Aid \\nThe Memory Aid prompts daily participant and parental assessment and recording in the \\nMemory Aid until 7 days following dosing, beginning about 8 hours post-dose on the dosing day \\nand thereafter each night. The participant/parent assesses and records observations of all signs \\nand symptoms at the injection site, systemic signs and symptoms, and other AEs. \\n\\nThe Memory Aid specifically prompts assessment of the solicited injection site reactions \\nconsidered to be study endpoints (Section 5.5.6). The participant’s/parent’s assessment of \\nreactogenicity will follow the Toxicity Grading Scale provided in Appendix II. The \\nparticipant/parent takes and records oral (adults) or axillary (toddlers and infants) temperature \\n(with thermometer provided by study staff) at each assessment time. The Memory Aid prompts \\nthat, if temperature exceeds 38 degrees Celsius, the participant/parent then repeats and \\nrecords temperature measurements every 4 hours until temperature is lower than 38 degrees \\nCelsius. Participants/parents will be provided with a standardized tool to measure diameter of \\npalpable swelling and erythema (redness). The Memory Aid prompts the participant/parent to \\ncall site staff if redness or swelling widest diameter exceeds grade 1.  \\n\\nThe Memory Aid is not used as the source document for data entry into the electronic data \\ncapture system. Study staff will review the Memory Aid with the participant/parent to elicit as \\nmuch information as possible about any reported symptoms. Based on this information, study \\nstaff will use their clinical judgment to assess the event, and its severity, and record the data on \\nthe source document that captures reactogenicity symptoms, which will be used for the \\npurposes of data entry. The existence of any discrepancies between the participant/parent and \\nstaff assessment of event severity will be noted on the case report form. The Memory Aid will be \\nretained with participant study records. \\n\\nOn Days 3 and 7 after each study injection, study staff will review the Memory Aid information \\nduring a scheduled clinic visit (for adults, Day 7 only). The participant/parent will be instructed to \\nbring the Memory Aid to any in-person clinic visits within 7 days after a vaccine administration.  \\n\\nAny additional, unsolicited symptoms will be similarly discussed with the participant/parent, and \\nclinic staff should evaluate the event(s) according to their clinical judgment and guidance \\nprovided in the protocol. This assessment should be described carefully in source documents \\nand entered on the AE form. Any reported Concomitant Medications are recorded on the \\nConcomitant Medications form. \\n\\n  \\n\\nPATH VAC 041 CSR - Study Information 16.1.1 v1.0; 20DEC2018\\n\\n \\nStudy Protocol: VAC 041  PATH Vaccine Solutions \\nVersion 4.0  21 June 2016 \\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL 99 \\n\\n14.4.
